# Exploring the Conversational Analytics dashboard in Platform Analytics experience

Use Conversational Analytics dashboard to improve Virtual Agent \(VA\) interactions with users. The dashboard provides insights into conversational data, and helps you refine topics and improve the deflection rate of VA.

## Conversational Analytics dashboard

Conversational Analytics dashboard provides insights into conversations so you can see how well Virtual Agent understood and resolved user issues. Virtual Agent keeps conversational data, that is, records of conversations with the users, and analytics data for up to two years. The dashboard contains indicators which, for example, reveal:

-   What percentage of users transfer from VA to a live agent
-   How to increase engagement rate and reduce user drop-offs
-   Whether the user reached the last node in a topic
-   Most and least used topics
-   Conversation details using advanced filters
-   How to optimize conversation design

    See the underperforming VA topics to investigate and improve topic performance.

## Overview of Conversational Analytics dashboard

The following sections provide a high-level overview of how to use each section of the dashboard from the top down.

-   **Date range of data displayed**

    The **Start date** and **End date** fields at the top of the dashboard specify the data range of the data summarized on each page.

    ![Virtual Agent chat data ranges shown by start and end dates in year-month-day format.](../images/dashboard-top-dates-pae.png)

    All data is continually pushed from Virtual Agent to the dashboard in real time, and retained for up to two years.

    For information about setting the date range, see Set the date range of the data.

    Certain data visualizations might not have data available for the start date and end date selected in the **Start date** and **End date** fields. In such cases, the indicator shows data for a start date and end date based on data availability within the selected date range.

-   **Getting detailed data**

    The **Overview** tab contains key indicators to help you evaluate the performance of VA. You can view more details in the following ways:

    -   Select a tab, for example, **Usage**.
    -   Select an indicator, for example, **Active VA users**.
