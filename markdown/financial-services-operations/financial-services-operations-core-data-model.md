# Financial Services Operations Core

The Financial Services Operations \(FSO\) Core application provides a framework to enable financial institutions to organize and manage their data effectively to meet their business needs. This section introduces FSO Core and explains its purpose and key data design components.

## Introduction to FSO Core

The Financial Services Operations Core data model enhances and utilizes tables from the ServiceNow AI Platform and the Customer Service Management \(CSM\) application to create a streamlined data environment. It organizes information into two main categories:

-   Foundational Data: This includes tables that store essential customer information such as financial accounts, product models, and transactions. These elements are crucial for handling customer service requests.
-   Operational Workflow Data: This records data generated during the execution of related processes, such as creating tasks and cases.
