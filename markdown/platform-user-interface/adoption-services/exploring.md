Dynamic Guidance provides an assistance that is fully embedded within the product, enabling users to access relevant information without navigating away from their Workflow.

Explore various features of Dynamic Guidance:

-   Voice and screen share options

    **Note:** User voice or screen share data is not stored. The transcript however, gets logged in the database.

-   Responses are based on ServiceNow® product documentation from the same family release as that of the instance you're on
-   Front-end component to invoke Dynamic Guidance and end a conversation
-   Option for multiple users running this simultaneously
-   Enabled to work across the ecosystem of ServiceNow
-   Near real-time experience and minimized latency
-   Browser support: In Firefox, while the entire screen or the app gets shared with screen share, you can choose to share only the desired tab in Google Chrome

    **Note:** Screen share is not supported in Safari.

-   30 minutes of audio and screen share support

    **Note:** You can cancel screen sharing anytime in the course of conversation.

-   Pause and resume conversation at your pace
-   Cross-tab control on pausing and ending the conversation although, the transcript can only be accessed from the launching tab of Dynamic Guidance
-   The chat window has a floating feature which makes it visible on any other open instance across browser tabs. You can control the conversation from the other open instance via floating chat window.

## How Dynamic Guidance works

When you ask a question that requires documentation lookup:

1.  User query: You ask a question via voice interface
2.  Gemini decision: Gemini Live API determines if knowledge base search is needed
3.  Tool call: Gemini invokes the knowledge base search tool with the query
4.  RAG API processing: RAG API Handler processes the query and searches XCC
5.  XCC search: XCC searches the crawled ServiceNow Docs content
6.  Results return: RAG API Handler formats and returns relevant documentation snippets
7.  Response Generation: Gemini synthesizes the answer using the retrieved content
