# Assign a view to Guided Tours

You can assign a list or form view to a step in a guided tour.

## Before you begin

Role required: guided\_tour\_admin

## About this task

To assign a view to a tour step, you must know the view name. The name you see in the context menu **View** option is the title of the view. Look up the view name before you assign it to a tour step.

**Note:** You can add a view to only one step in a guided tour, and this is only possible if the step begins in the default view. When the tour is played and that step is executed, the user interface refreshes to display the new view.

## Procedure

1.  Complete the following steps to find the view name:

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System UI** &gt; **Views**.

        The first two columns are **Name** and **Title**.

    2.  Locate the view by its **Title**, and note the value in the **Name** column.

2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Guided Tours Designer** &gt; **Guided Tours**.

3.  Open the tour to be modified.

4.  Under Related Links, from the Guided Tour Steps, select the step you want to add a view.

    2.  In the Guided Tour Designer tab or window, select **Play**.

    3.  Verify that the step you modified displays the correct view.
