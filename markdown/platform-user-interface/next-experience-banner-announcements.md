# Next Experience banner announcements

Banner announcements enable you to communicate planned maintenance, unplanned outages, or important events like ESPP stock plans or benefits enrollment to those affected or to everyone. You can target specific experiences or all experiences.

**Note:** Beginning with the San Diego release, configure banner announcements instead of updating the **glide.product.description** system property.

You can configure the following aspects of banner announcements:

-   Use colors and icons to communicate the type of announcement and the importance of the banner announcement.
-   Provide a link for information or to complete a task.
-   Schedule banner announcements for a specific time.

    **Note:** If a user dismisses a banner announcement during a session and the announcement is still active, it will re-appear once the user logs out and back in to a new session.
