# Define user actions for task logging

Group workstation user actions as a task that can be logged to provide data for a Task activity analysis.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_tm\_core.analyst, sn\_tm\_core.power\_user, sn\_tm\_core.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Task Mining Workspace**.

2.  Navigate to the project you want to group tasks for.

3.  Select **Task scope** from the left navigation.

    If the list of active tasks is empty, no tasks have been defined for this project.

4.  Select **Skip** if you aren't adding any mapped or user-initiated tasks.

5.  Select **Add task scope**.

6.  Select the type of task scope you want to create.

    The available options are:

    -   **Automated**

        Activity collection is based on mapped task activities.

    -   **User-initiated**

        Activity collection is user-initiated tasks. Workstation users to start and stop activity collection by following instructions. Targeted activity collection only uses user-initiated task scopes, and at least one task must be defined if you choose this option.
