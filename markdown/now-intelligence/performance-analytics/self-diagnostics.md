# Performance Analytics diagnostics

Identify and diagnose configuration issues using predefined scripts that examine the database for invalid records and provide suggestions to resolve issues.

Each diagnostic consists of a script or database query with a severity code, message text, and suggested solution. Diagnostics are read-only. You cannot create or edit diagnostics.

You can run one or all diagnostics against all applicable records, or you can run all applicable diagnostics against one record.

**Warning:** Performance Analytics diagnostics do not apply to Platform Analytics artifacts. For example, an indicator that is not used in any widgets might still be used in a Platform Analytics data visualization, but the diagnostics are not able to recognize that use.
