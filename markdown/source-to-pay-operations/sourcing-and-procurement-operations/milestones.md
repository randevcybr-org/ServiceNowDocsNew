</table>Milestones are assigned to the recipient of the purchase line. A recipient can either confirm, cancel, or defer milestones using **Confirm completion**, **Cancel**, or **Defer Completion** options.

-   Confirming a milestone updates the state to **Closed Complete**.
-   Canceling a milestone requires a cancellation reason.
-   Deferring the completion of a milestone requires a completion date and the state is updated to **Pending Completion Date**.

When the status of a milestone task is **Closed Complete**, a receipt is created and the **Amount received** or **Percentage received** fields are populated accordingly on the receipt. The receipt triggers the update of the states on the purchase order line and purchase order similar to the workflow of a good receipt.

The \[PSM\] Monitor Milestone Tasks scheduled job monitors the completion date of each active milestone on a daily basis. On the specified date of completion, the job updates the state of the milestone from **Pending Completion Date** to **Confirmation Required**.

The UI action to confirm or defer the milestone is displayed when the state of the milestone is **Confirmation Required**.
