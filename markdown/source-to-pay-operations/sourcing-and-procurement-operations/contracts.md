# Contracts

A contract defines the terms and conditions along with pricing agreed for a product with the supplier​. An active contractual price determines if the pricing of a product or service is displayed on ShoppingHub.

Use the purchasing view to view contract details in the Sourcing and Purchasing Automation module. You can also create a new contract with the contract\_manager role.

In addition to purchase requisitions, systematic creation of a contract occurs during a sourcing request or negotiation. This is configured accordingly in flow designer. The various scenarios for pre-purchase contract creation are:

-   Negotiation exists, created manually: Trigger contract creation, including NDA if required, against the negotiation when the state of the negotiation is Planned.
-   Negotiation exists, created systematically through third-party sourcing integration: Trigger contract creation, including NDA if required, against the negotiation when the state of the negotiation is Negotiation in Progress.
-   Negotiation does not exist: Trigger NDA contract creation, if required, against the sourcing request when the state of the sourcing request is Awaiting Supplier Response. A procurement specialist or contract team can manually create other contracts against the sourcing request before creating a purchase requisition. If contracts are not manually created against the sourcing request, they are systematically created against the awarded purchase requisition after approvals are complete.
-   New supplier created from manual sourcing or third-party sourcing integration: For third-party sourcing integration, trigger contract creation when a new purchase line is created for a new supplier. For manual sourcing, contract creation follows the manual negotiation creation or negotiation does not exist scenarios.

When a supplier is awarded, contracts that were created for the other suppliers are canceled, except NDAs. Contract metadata population remain as is.
