# Receipts

Receipts reference a purchase order line. Depending on the product type of the purchase, a goods receipt or services receipt is generated.

**Note:** If you’re an existing customer continuing with the Source-to-Pay Common Architecture \(sn\_shop\) plugin, and skipping the Shopping Hub \(sn\_spend\_uib\) plugin, service acknowledgment is replaced with invoice acknowledgment for you.

For a product of the type service, if the acknowledgment type is **Milestones**, then confirming a milestone also results in receipt generation. However, if the acknowledgment type is **Two way match**, receipt creation is disabled for this purchase order line.

Receipts can either be a partial or full receipt, and are used determine the status of the associated purchase order line and purchase order.
