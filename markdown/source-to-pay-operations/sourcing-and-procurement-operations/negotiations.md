</table>## Negotiation state flows

The status of the purchase line and the sourcing request updates automatically depending on the status of the negotiation. Negotiations are grouped by supplier.

-   When the state of the negotiation is updated to Awaiting Supplier Response, all applicable purchase requisition lines, for the same supplier, of sourcing requests associated to the negotiation are also updated to Awaiting Supplier Response. The purchase requisition lines not belonging to sourcing requests associated to the negotiation aren’t updated.
-   When all applicable purchase requisition lines, for the same supplier, of sourcing requests associated to the negotiation are updated to Pricing Obtained, the state of the negotiation should be Closed Complete. If one purchase requisition line is in Pricing Obtained state, while another is still in Awaiting Supplier Response, the state of the negotiation remains in the Awaiting Supplier Response state.
-   When the state of the negotiation is updated to Negotiation in Progress, all applicable purchase requisition lines, for the same supplier, of sourcing requests associated to the negotiation are updated to Negotiation in Progress. The purchase requisition lines not belonging to sourcing requests associated to the negotiation aren’t updated.
-   When the state of the negotiation is updated to Closed Complete or Closed Canceled, no state updates are affected on the purchase requisition lines.
