# Create sourcing request from the ITAM Workspace

As an asset manager, use SPO’s sourcing flow from the ITAM Workspace to complete checkout when the requested item doesn’t have contractual pricing.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_spend\_asset.spo\_shopper

## About this task

This task describes the options you need to select and the information you need to provide after you select **Request items and checkout** when the requested item does not have an associated price.

During checkout, asset managers interact with a user interface that is similar to Shopping Hub’s "I need a product" record producer to provide key details about the product to be sourced.

## Procedure

1.  Complete steps 1 through 10 as described in [Create Sourcing Request or Purchase Requisition in SPO via ITAM Workspace](spo-itam-submit-requests.md).

2.  On the Select the preferred supplier for the following items page, select **Request items and checkout**.
