# Receipt tasks

Receipt tasks are created when goods receipt is required for the purchase line.

A receipt task references a purchase order and is grouped by the recipient and the calendar month of the product's expected delivery date. A receipt task is created only during the month of the expected delivery date, irrespective of the purchase order creation date, and remains open until all the expected deliveries for the recipient in a calendar month are confirmed. This is done using the \[PSM\] Create Receiving Task scheduled job.

Consider the following example:

The current month is September 2020, and for a purchase order, there are five purchase order lines:

|Purchase order line|Expected delivery date|Recipient|
|-------------------|----------------------|---------|
|1|September 10, 2020|John|
|2|September 20, 2020|John|
|3|October 22, 2020|John|
|4|September 12, 2020|Peter|
|5|October 5, 2020|John|

On the purchase order, three receipt tasks are created as follows:

-   Receipt task 1, associated to purchase order line 1 and 2, is created on September 1, 2020, with the state **Open**.
-   Receipt task 2, associated to purchase order line 3 and 5, is created on October 1, 2020, with the state **Open**.
-   Receipt task 3, associated to purchase order line 4, is created on September 1, 2020, with the state **Open**.

You can view all receipt tasks from the **Receipt Acknowledgment** sub-module under the Sourcing and Purchasing Automation module. The following are the key fields of a receipt task:
