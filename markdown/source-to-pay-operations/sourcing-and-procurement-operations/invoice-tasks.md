# Invoice tasks

Invoice tasks, an extension of acknowledgment tasks, lists invoice tasks in the Open, Work in Progress, and Closed Rejected status.

**Note:** If you are a new customer, or an existing customer who has upgraded and installed the Shopping Hub \(sn\_spend\_uib\) plugin, these tasks aren't applicable for you. However, if you choose to continue with the existing Source-to-Pay Common Architecture \(sn\_shop\) plugin and skip the Shopping Hub plugin, these tasks are available for you to work on.

When an invoice acknowledgment is triggered, a task is created against the invoice and displayed as an Invoice Task related list on the Invoice form view.

You can view these invoice tasks from the **Receipt Acknowledgment** sub-module under the Sourcing and Purchasing Automation module. The following are the key fields of an invoice task:
