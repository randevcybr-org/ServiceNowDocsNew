# Restructured Invoice table

The invoice and invoice line tables are restructured in the Xanadu release.

Before Washington DC release, invoice and invoice line tables were standalone tables. With Xanadu release, the following changes are done:

-   The invoice table \[sn\_shop\_invoice\] extends the base invoice table \[sn\_fin\_base\_invoice\].
-   The invoice line table \[sn\_shop\_invoice\_line\] extends the base invoice line table \[sn\_fin\_base\_invoice\_line\].

After you upgrade from Washington DC to Australia release, verify that your existing invoice and invoice line data has been migrated correctly. If you notice that your invoice and invoice line tables didn’t migrate properly, use the [Now Support Portal](https://support.servicenow.com/now) to raise a case with the Technical Support team.
