# Integration errors in staging tables

Integration errors caused by the target ERP sources are recorded in the form of system-generated integration error tasks \(outbound integration error\). You can view the integration tasks associated with Procurement and Sourcing Operations, Supplier Lifecycle Operations and Accounts Payable Operations in the **Tasks** area of the Source-to-Pay workspace.

The integration errors are categorized as:

-   Outbound integration Error-occurs when the outbound staging record is run and the sub flows in the target ERP source fails due to an error. Example: Connection error. The sub flow auto-updates the error message in the **Processing message** field of the outbound staging table and sets the **Integration status** to error. The system auto-creates error task for erroneous record and auto-assigns to a specialist.
-   Inbound integration error- Occurs when the inbound flow fails to fetch the primary data from the target ERP sources due to error in the master flow or ERP subflow. The **Error** field in the inbound staging table is auto-updated with the appropriate error message.

A specialist can reinitiate the integration activity after fixing the integration errors. Bulk records are integrated through scheduled jobs.
