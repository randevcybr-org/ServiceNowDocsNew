## Prerequisites

First, you must activate the Source-to-Pay integration with the Oracle Financial Cloud application from the ServiceNow Store. This automatically activates the Oracle Financial Cloud Spoke. Next you must set up [Oracle Financial Cloud Spoke](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/csh?topicname=setup-oracle-fin-cloud&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-integrate-applications).

ServiceNow Store app plugins: sn\_Oracle Financial Cloud\_spoke.

**Note:** The Source-to-Pay integration with Oracle Financial Cloud depends on the [Oracle Financial Cloud Spoke](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/csh?topicname=oracle-fin-cloud&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-integrate-applications).

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## How it works

The subflows enable a plug-and-play experience for the integration scenarios. Integration Hub Actions provide the building blocks for Source-to-Pay subflows and connects to the Oracle Financial Cloud system through REST APIs.
