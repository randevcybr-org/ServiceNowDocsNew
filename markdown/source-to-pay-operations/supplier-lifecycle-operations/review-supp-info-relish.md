# Review supplier information using Relish

Using Relish integration, checking supplier's banking details, physical addresses, and sanction screening can be done efficiently.

**Important:** Check your entitlements to determine whether you have access to Relish integration.

The details of the following case types in the **Review supplier primary data request** playbook can be verified using Relish integration:

-   Banking information change request
-   Supplier location change request
-   Conduct sanction screening

For more information on required and dependent plugins for Relish, see [Relish Integration for Supplier Lifecycle Operations](relish-slo-connector.md).

## Verifying Supplier location change request

When a location change request is assigned to a supplier manager and they start working on it, they can verify the new location by clicking **Validate**.

Clicking the **Validate** button invokes the Relish verification process.

It takes few minutes for Relish to complete the verification process. Depending on the result, the supplier manager can approve or reject the request.

Also, a notification can be sent to the requester.
