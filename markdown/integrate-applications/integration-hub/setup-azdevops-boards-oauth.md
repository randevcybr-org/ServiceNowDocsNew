# Set up the Microsoft Azure DevOps Boards spoke using OAuth

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and Azure DevOps Boards using OAuth 2.0 authentication to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate Azure DevOps Boards spoke
-   Role required: admin.

**Important:**

-   If you are setting up the Azure DevOps Boards spoke using OAuth, you need not set up the spoke using personal access token.
-   If the Azure DevOps Boards spoke is already configured and set up, ensure that you set the value of **Active** to **false** for the existing connection before you proceed to set up the spoke using OAuth.
