# Set up the Oracle EBS spoke

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and your Oracle EBS instance using a basic authentication to authenticate the ServiceNow requests.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the Oracle EBS spoke.
-   Admin access to the Oracle EBS account.
-   Role required: admin.

## Set up for Oracle Database 12C and later versions

Configure Oracle Database 12C and later versions to work with the Oracle E-Business Suite spoke by deploying REST APIs and setting up ServiceNow connections.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  From the [ServiceNow® Store Oracle E-Business Suite Spoke Dependencies for Oracle Database 12c and 18c](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/3e41ef4adb7fe81039f49ee4db961994) download the project file, Oracle\_e-business\_suite spoke\_dependencies.zip and save it in the required local folder.

2.  Unzip the contents of the Oracle\_e-business\_suite spoke\_dependencies.zip file.

3.  In SQL Developer or an SQL client, compile all the PKB and PLS files in the APPS schema.

    ![Compile the PLS and PKB files.](../image/oebs-compile.png)

4.  In Oracle EBS server, deploy the Oracle EBS REST API.

    For the steps to enable the REST API per extension, see [Deploying REST Web Services](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18727_01/doc.121/e12169/T682519T513044.htm#isgig_restdeploy).

    You must perform these steps for every PLS file. While deploying each PLS file, you must provide the relevant values. Here, the procedure is outlined using `XXSN_CREATE_PO_PKG.pls` as an example.

    1.  Copy and upload the compiled package .pls files to these respective directories:

        -   `$PO_TOP/patch/115/sql/tmp/`
        -   `$PO_TOP/patch/115/sql/`
        **Note:** Ensure that you replace the `$PO_TOP` with the module the package belongs to such as, `$AP_TOP`, `$PO_TOP`, and so on.

    2.  Log in to PuTTY of your Oracle EBS server and execute the Integration Repository Parser.

        1.  To generate an iLDT \(\*.ildt\) file, execute the Integration Repository Parser using this syntax:

            ```
            $IAS_ORACLE_HOME/perl/bin/perl $FND_TOP/bin/irep_parser.pl -g -v -username=sysadmin po:patch/115/sql:XXSN_CREATE_PO_PKG.pls:12.0=$PO_TOP/patch/115/sql/tmp/XXSN_CREATE_PO_PKG.pls
            ```

        2.  If you aren't generating .ildt file for the XXSN\_CREATE\_PO\_PKG.pls file, replace `po` and `$PO_TOP` with required `Top`.
        3.  If you aren't generating .ildt file for the XXSN\_CREATE\_PO\_PKG.pls file, replace `XXSN_CREATE_PO_PKG.pls` with the required package name.
        ![Uploaded package name](../image/oebs-package-name.png)

    3.  Upload the generated iLDT file to Integration repository by executing this command:

        ```
        $FND_TOP/bin/FNDLOAD apps/apps 0 Y UPLOAD $FND_TOP/patch/115/import/wfirep.lct XXSN_CREATE_PO_PKG_pls.ildt
        ```

        **Note:** Replace `XXSN_CREATE_PO_PKG_` with the required package name.

## Set up for Oracle Database 19C and later versions

Configure Oracle Database 19C and later versions to work with the Oracle E-Business Suite spoke by deploying REST APIs and setting up ServiceNow connections.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  From the [ServiceNow® Store Oracle EBS Spoke Dependencies for Oracle Database 19c or later](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/dd28be0e977bb6d00cd036a71153af10/1.0.0) download the project file, Oracle\_e-business\_suite spoke\_dependencies.zip and save it in the required local folder.

2.  Unzip the contents of the Oracle\_e-business\_suite spoke\_dependencies.zip file.

3.  In SQL Developer or an SQL client, compile all the PKB and PLS files in the APPS schema.

4.  Review the module package reference to identify the correct values for your deployment.

    The following table lists the `.pls` filename, `$TOP` variable, product short-code, and service alias required for each Oracle EBS module. Use the values in this table wherever the steps below reference a module-specific path, product code, or alias.

    |Module|Package \(.pls filename\)|$TOP variable|Product code|Service alias|
    |------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
    |General Ledger|`xxsn_gl_integration_pkg.pls`|`$GL_TOP`|`gl`|`xxsn_gl_integration_pkg`|
    |AP — Supplier|`xxsn_supplier_integration_pkg.pls`|`$AP_TOP`|`ap`|`xxsn_supplier_integration_pkg`|
    |Purchasing|`xxsn_po_integration_pkg.pls`|`$PO_TOP`|`po`|`xxsn_po_integration_pkg`|
    |Accounts Payable|`xxsn_ap_integration_pkg.pls`|`$AP_TOP`|`ap`|`xxsn_ap_integration_pkg`|
    |Fixed Assets|`xxsn_fa_integration_pkg.pls`|`$FA_TOP`|`fa`|`xxsn_fa_integration_pkg`|
    |Sourcing|`xxsn_pon_integration_pkg.pls`|`$PON_TOP`|`pon`|`xxsn_pon_integration_pkg`|
    |Inventory|`xxsn_inv_integration_pkg.pls`|`$INV_TOP`|`inv`|`xxsn_inv_integration_pkg`|
    |Common|`xxsn_common_integration_pkg.pls`|`$FND_TOP`|`fnd`|`xxsn_common_integration_pkg`|
    |Receivables|`xxsn_ar_integrations_pkg.pls`|`$AR_TOP`|`ap`|`xxsn_ar_integrations_pkg`|
    |Order Management|`xxsn_om_integration_pkg.pls`|`$ONT_TOP`|`ont`|`xxsn_om_integration_pkg`|

5.  In Oracle EBS server, deploy the Oracle EBS REST API.

    For the steps to enable the REST API per extension, see [Deploying REST Web Services](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18727_01/doc.121/e12169/T682519T513044.htm#isgig_restdeploy).

    You must perform these steps for every PLS file. While deploying each PLS file, you must provide the relevant values. Here, the procedure is outlined using `xxsn_gl_integration_pkg.pls` as an example.

    1.  Copy and upload the compiled package .pls files to these respective directories:

        -   `$GL_TOP/patch/115/sql/tmp/`
        -   `$GL_TOP/patch/115/sql/`
        **Note:** Ensure that you replace the `$GL_TOP` with the `$TOP` variable for the module the package belongs to. For the correct `$TOP` variable per module, see the module package reference table in the previous step.

        ![Upload the .pls file to the Oracle EBS application server directories.](../image/oebs-upload-pls-19c.jpg)

    2.  Grant `777` permissions to the uploaded `.pls` file.

        In your SFTP client, right-click the `.pls` file, click **Properties**, and set the **Octal** permission value to `0777`.

        ![Properties dialog showing Octal permission set to 0777 for the .pls file.](../image/oebs-file-permissions-19c.jpg)

        **Note:** 777 permissions are required for the Integration Repository parser to process the file. Without this step, the command in the next substep fails.

    3.  Log in to PuTTY of your Oracle EBS server and execute the Integration Repository Parser.

        1.  To generate an iLDT \(\*.ildt\) file, execute the Integration Repository Parser using this syntax:

            ```
            $IAS_ORACLE_HOME/perl/bin/perl $FND_TOP/bin/irep_parser.pl -g -v -username=sysadmin gl:patch/115/sql:xxsn_gl_integration_pkg.pls:12.0=$GL_TOP/patch/115/sql/xxsn_gl_integration_pkg.pls
            ```

        2.  If you aren't generating the .ildt file for the `xxsn_gl_integration_pkg.pls` file, replace `gl` and `$GL_TOP` with the product code and `$TOP` variable for the required module. For the correct values per module, see the module package reference table in the previous step.
        3.  If you aren't generating the .ildt file for the `xxsn_gl_integration_pkg.pls` file, replace `xxsn_gl_integration_pkg.pls` with the required package name.
        ![PuTTY terminal showing irep_parser.pl output ending with Done all files.](../image/oebs-irep-parser-output-19c.jpg)

    4.  Upload the generated iLDT file to Integration repository by executing this command:

        ```
        $FND_TOP/bin/FNDLOAD apps/apps 0 Y UPLOAD $FND_TOP/patch/115/import/wfirep.lct xxsn_gl_integration_pkg_pls.ildt
        ```

        **Note:** Replace `xxsn_gl_integration_pkg_` with the required package name.

        ![PuTTY terminal showing FNDLOAD command with log filename and report filename output.](../image/oebs-fndload-output-19c.jpg)
