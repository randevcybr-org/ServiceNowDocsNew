# Set up the Calendly spoke

Set up an outbound integration between your ServiceNow instance and the Calendly APIs by creating an OAuth application in Calendly and a connection and credential record on your ServiceNow instance.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the Calendly spoke.

## About this task

After setting the outbound integration, you can set up a flow on the Workflow Studio using the Calendly spoke actions and automate tasks in Calendly. For example, you can set up a flow that cancels an event on Calendly.
