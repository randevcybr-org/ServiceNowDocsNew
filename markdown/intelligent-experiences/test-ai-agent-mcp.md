2.  In the **Test AI reasoning** tab, use the Search bar to search and select the AI agent that you want to test.

3.  In the Version drop-down list, select the version of the AI agent.

6.  Select **Log in** and authenticate the MCP server to complete the testing.

    **Note:**

    -   Log in will be visible only if the server isn’t authenticated.
    -   Enabling access to the MCP Server refreshes the whole Testing page and resumes testing in the Chat responses tab. The OAuth token used for the authentication is saved in the OAuth Credentials table \[oauth\_credential\].
