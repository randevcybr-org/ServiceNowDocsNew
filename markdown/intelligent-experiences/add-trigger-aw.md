# Add a trigger to an agentic workflow

In the guided setup for an agentic workflow, add triggers to run the agentic workflow automatically when certain conditions are met.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_aia.admin

## About this task

Adding a trigger is optional. If you want your agentic workflow to be used only in chats such as in Now Assist for Virtual Agent or Now Assist panel, you don't need to add a trigger. Only add a trigger if you want to invoke the agentic workflow automatically when some event occurs.

If you don't want to add a trigger, skip to the final step, [Select channels and access](channels-access-aw.md).

## Procedure

1.  Select **Add trigger**.

2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Fields|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |Select trigger|List of triggers that are available in the instance.|
    |Name|Name of the trigger.|
    |Trigger objective|Additional user statements or sample utterances that help guide when to trigger this agentic workflow.|

Name of the applicable table for your agentic workflow.

Conditions

Conditions that you can add to control the trigger configuration. You must have at least one condition.Select **+ Add condition set** to add conditions to your agentic workflow trigger.

Only enable the trigger once you’re confident in the execution of your agentic workflow. Try testing the [agentic workflow execution](test-aia-use-case.md) and [user access](test-aw-access.md) first. To review overall trends over many executions, try an [automated evaluation](execute-aia-eval.md).

    If you choose a scheduled trigger, additional options are available, such as the day of the week and time when you want the trigger to run.

    **Note:** When running a scheduled trigger, not every record is included in the execution. By default, the value is 10. If you want to change this number, you must set the **sn\_aia.max\_scheduled\_trigger\_query** system property to a different value.

    If you choose an email trigger, the target emails must exist on the Reply \[sys\_reply\] table. New emails aren’t available as triggers.

3.  Select **Add**.

4.  Repeat the preceding steps for additional triggers.


## Result

You have added triggers to your agentic workflow to run it automatically under the specified conditions.

## What to do next

Select **Save and continue** to move to the final step, [Select channels and access](channels-access-aw.md).
