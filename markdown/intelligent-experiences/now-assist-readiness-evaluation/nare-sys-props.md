Use system properties to customize your readiness assessment results. Access these properties from the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table.

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

sn\_assess.assessment\_limit

</td><td>

Reduce performance issues when a large volume of data is assessed. Adjust this system property, if needed, so that the job can run successfully. The default value is `10000`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_assess.effort\_visibility

</td><td>

Customize the estimated remediation effort for select efforts. This property controls multiple sections associated with remediation effort. The default value is `false`. When this system property is set to `true`, the **Remediation properties** tab appears on the Now Assist Readiness Evaluation dashboard. You customize the estimated remediation efforts via the **Remediation properties** tab. All input values represent estimated remediation efforts in days. After making changes to the estimated remediation efforts, select **Save**, and then re-run the assessments to see the updated remediation efforts reflected.

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_assess.task\_limit

</td><td>

Decide the maximum number of records to process for the ITSM assessment. The default value is `50`. Be cautious of setting a higher limit or leaving the value empty since that would fetch all active records which could impact performance.
