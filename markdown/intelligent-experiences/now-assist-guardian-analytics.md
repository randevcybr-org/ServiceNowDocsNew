# Now Assist Guardian analytics

Monitor the performance of guardrails enabled through Now Assist Guardian.

The Now Assist Guardian analytics dashboard helps admins monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of offensive content and prompt injection guardrails in tracking and analyzing requests sent to large language models \(LLM\) and their responses.

The indicators on the Now Assist Guardian dashboard page provide the following insights.

-   Average latency as a result of active offensive content and prompt injection guardrails. High latency could mean increased guardrail activity in the period.
-   Count and percentage of offensive content and prompt injection occurrences.
-   Skills where offensive content and prompt injection occurrences were detected.

Apply the filters on the dashboard to view guardrail activity for skills in a date range. See [Now Assist Analytics dashboard indicator details](now-assist-analytics-dashboard-indicators.md) for information on the data and calculations behind each indicator.
