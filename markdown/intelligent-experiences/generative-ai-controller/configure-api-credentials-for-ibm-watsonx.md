# Configure API credentials for IBM watsonx

Configure your API credentials to use IBM watsonx Granite models in custom workflows and Virtual Agent Designer topics.

## Before you begin

To use IBM watsonx large language models \(LLMs\), you must configure your credentials to use the Generative AI Controller capabilities.

Role required: admin

## About this task

In order to use models with IBM watsonx as your LLM provider for Generative AI Controller capabilities, you must have an active connection configured.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credential Aliases**.

2.  Open the record named IBM watsonx.

3.  Select the **Create New Connection &amp; Credential** related link.

    For more information about generating an API key, see IBM's [documentation for generating API keys for authentication](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/watsonxdata/1.1.x?topic=started-generating-api-keys).

5.  Create a connection by selecting **Create**.


## Result

You can now use capabilities labeled with IBM watson in Flow Designer, Virtual Agent Designer, and scripts like background scripts and business rules to create custom experiences with generative AI.
