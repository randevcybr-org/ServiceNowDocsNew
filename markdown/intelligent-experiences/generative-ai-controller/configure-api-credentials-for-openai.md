# Configure API credentials for OpenAI

Configure your API credentials to use OpenAI in custom workflows and Virtual Agent Designer topics.

## Before you begin

To use the OpenAI and Azure OpenAI large language models \(LLMs\), you must configure your credentials to use the Generative AI Controller capabilities.
