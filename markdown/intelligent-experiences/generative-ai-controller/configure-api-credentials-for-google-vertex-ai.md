# Create API credentials for Google Vertex AI

Configure your API credentials to use Google Vertex AI in custom workflows and Virtual Agent Designer topics.

## Before you begin

You must have a Google Cloud project and the permissions to generate new OAuth credentials.

Role required: admin

## About this task

In order to use Google Vertex AI as your LLM provider for Generative AI Controller capabilities, you must have an active connection configured.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials Aliases**.

2.  Open the record for Google Bard Vertex AI.

3.  Select the **Create New Connection &amp; Credential** related link.

The name of your credential, such as `Google OAuth Credential`

</td></tr><tr><td>

To get the OAuth Client ID, create a new OAuth Client ID with the Google Cloud console with the following attributes: 1.  Application type: `Web application`
2.  Authorized redirect URI: URL in the OAuth Redirect URL field, usually `<instance>.service-now.com/oauth_redirect.do`
 For more information, see the [Google documentation for creating OAuth client IDs](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849). Once you have created the OAuth client, a pop-up window will have the Client ID and Client secret for you to copy into your clipboard.

## Result

You can now use Completions – Vertex AI and Chat Completions – Vertex AI in Flow Designer, Virtual Agent Designer, and scripts to create custom experiences with generative AI.
