2.  Open an existing agent or create agent.

3.  Select **Edit**.

4.  Select **Tools**.

6.  Select **+ New tool**.

7.  Select **Model Context Protocol**.

8.  Select the MCP server from the drop-down.

    **Note:** In AWH for AI Control Tower \(2.0.0\), unapproved MCP Servers appear in the list but tools cannot be fetched until the server is approved in AI Control Tower.

9.  Select the specific tools from the MCP server that the agent should use.
