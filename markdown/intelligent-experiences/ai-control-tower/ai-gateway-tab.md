# AI Gateway tab in AI Control Tower

Explore the AI Gateway tab in the AI Control Tower.

## AI Gateway overview

**Prerequisites**

Role required: AI steward \[sn\_ai\_governance.ai\_steward\]

The AI Gateway tab shows the metrics at the MCP \(Model Context Protocol\) server level, listing all connected MCP servers along with the total number of transactions for each server and its success rate.

The AI Gateway displays a comprehensive view of all MCP servers categorized into:

-   Name
-   Total transactions
-   Success rate

Total transactions are all tool calls, calculated by MCP method equal, which is \("tools/call"\).

The success rate is the number of such transactions that have an HTTP status from 200 through 299 divided by the total.
