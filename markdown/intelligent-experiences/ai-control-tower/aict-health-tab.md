# Health tab in AI Control Tower

Monitor the performance of guardrails enabled through Now Assist Guardian.

The Health tab in the AI Control Tower dashboard helps you monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of offensive content and prompt injection guardrails active on your ServiceNow AI assets.

![Health tab showing the metrics for offensive content and prompt injection guardrails.](../image/aict-health-tab.png "Health tab in AI Control Tower")

The visualizations on the Health tab provide the following insights.

-   Average latency as a result of active offensive content and prompt injection guardrails. High latency could mean increased guardrail activity in the period.
-   Count and percentage of offensive content and prompt injection occurrences.
-   Skills where offensive content and prompt injection occurrences were detected.

The dashboard does not consider historical data for Health metrics.

Apply the filters on the dashboard to view guardrail activity for skills in a date range.

## Content guardrail effectiveness

-   **Number of content items flagged**

    This area of the dashboard shows the number of offensive content and prompt injection occurrences in the selected date range.

-   **Percentage of content items flagged of total use**

    This area of the dashboard shows the percentage of requests and responses to and from the large language model \(LLM\) service that are flagged for offensiveness and prompt injection.

## Offensive content visualizations

-   **Guardrail-added latency**

    This area of the dashboard shows the average latency as a result of the active offensive content guardrail for the selected skills and date range.

-   **Categories of offensive content**

    This area of the dashboard shows a breakdown of offensive content occurrences by the categories. If content is deemed to be offensive under more than one category, for example, toxic and defamatory, the occurrence is counted individually toward both the categories. For more information on offensive content categories, see .

-   **Offensive content occurrences by skill**

    This area of the dashboard shows the number of offensive content occurrences over time by the skills in which the content is detected.

## Prompt injection visualizations

-   **Guardrail-added latency**

    This area of the dashboard shows the average latency as a result of the active prompt injection guardrail for the selected skills and date range.
