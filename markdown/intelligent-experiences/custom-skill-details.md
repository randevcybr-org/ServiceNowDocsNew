# Custom skill details

Use the Custom skill details dashboard page to view usage and performance indicators of custom skills.

The Custom skill details dashboard page contains indicators pertaining to a custom skill. The indicators provide insight into skill usage and performance. Select a skill from the Skills drop-down list to view the indicators. The drop-down lists both active and inactive skills. Each skill has a subtitle that identifies the skill family that it belongs to, for example, ITSM, HR, and so on. Use the date range filter to view skill usage and performance over a certain period. The date range filter selection applies to all visualizations on the page. See [Now Assist Analytics dashboard indicator details](now-assist-analytics-dashboard-indicators.md) for information on the data and calculations behind each indicator.
