# Using latest assessment template for conducting BIAs

Beginning with the Yokohama release, you can use the latest assessment template for conducting a Business Impact Analysis \(BIA\). The BIA template is now integrated with the Smart Assessment Engine, enabling you to use the Smart Assessment along with the legacy assessment.

## Integrating BIA with the Smart Assessment Engine

Integrating business impact analysis \(BIA\) with the Smart Assessment Engine allows you to configure impact analysis assessments with various question types, set up multiple impact assessment templates for a single BIA, and calculate metrics such as Recovery Time Objective \(RTO\), Recovery Point Objective \(RPO\), Recovery Tier \(RT\), Maximum tolerable period of disruption \(MTPD\), and other based on user responses.

A BIA created with the Smart Assessment template includes Smart Assessment instances in the assessment section. The assessment template introduced with the Smart Assessment Engine allows you to create various question types and automate responses from existing data sources. BCM users can complete the assessment, and upon submission, the automation set up by BCM administrators updates impact analysis data, including recovery time objective \(RTO\), recovery point objective \(RPO\), recovery tier, or maximum tolerable downtime, based on the defined configuration.

## Components used for the integration

For BIA integration with the Smart Assessment Engine, these BCM components are used:

-   BCM core
-   BIA
-   Smart Assessment Engine

## Workflow for integrating BIA with the Smart Assessment Engine

The ServiceNow® Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) application helps you to reduce the manual burden and costs of your assessment processes through automation.

You can create the assessment templates and add instructions, questions, and reference information by using the template designer in the Smart Assessment Engine application.

The Smart Assessment Engine uses the rule engine, where the rules are based on user responses. You can fill one assessment template \(only one assessment for RTO, RPO, and RT\) or multiple assessment templates \(one for each RTO, RPO, and RT\).

The workflow for integrating BIA with the Smart Assessment Engine is shown in the illustration.

## Configuring BIA templates

You can configure the BIA template with the legacy or Smart Assessment. The legacy assessment shows only drop-down questions, while the Smart Assessment enables multiple question types and configures RTO, RPO, and recovery tier calculations based on the responses to the questionnaire. For more information, see [Setup for a business impact analysis](bcm-admin-tasks.md).

</table>## UI actions

The UI actions used for performing the Smart Assessment are listed in the table.

|Roles|Responsibilities|
|-----|----------------|
|**Open assessment**|Action to open the assessment. The BIA viewer, BIA contributor, BIA planner, and BIA manager can read the impact analysis and they can also view the **Open assessment** UI action. This UI action redirects you to the Smart Assessment page in read-only mode.|
|**Edit assessment**|Action to edit the assessment. The BIA planner, BIA contributor, and BIA manager can write the impact analysis and they can also view the **Edit assessment** UI action. This UI action redirects you to the Smart Assessment page in edit mode.|

## UI page with the Smart Assessment component for an assessment instance

The UI page containing only the Smart Assessment component is created in the BCM core application and it can be accessed by the BCM Workspace users. This page allows users to open the Smart Assessment in read-only or edit mode.

## User experience

-   BCM administrators can configure the Smart Assessment template from the Business Continuity Workspace.
-   You can view the Smart Assessment instance card in the assessment list from the **Assessments** tab in the BIA, if the BIA template is configured to use the Smart Assessment template.
-   For the Smart Assessment instance card, you can either view both **Edit assessment** and **Open assessment**, or only the **Open assessment** button based on your role.
-   The **Open assessment** action opens the Smart Assessment page for you to read the responses.
-   The **Edit assessment** action opens the Smart Assessment page for you to edit the responses.
