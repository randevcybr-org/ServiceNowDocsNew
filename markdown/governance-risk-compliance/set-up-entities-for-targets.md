# Set up entities for the targets

Set up an entity record in the instance and map it to an incident or security incident. You can map one or multiple entities to the selected incident.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_oper\_res.admin, sn\_dri\_inc\_rptg.digital\_resilience\_incident\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace** and open an incident from the list view.

2.  To add one or multiple entities to the selected incident, select **Add** in the Entities related list.

    The Entities related list is shown in the example.

    1.  Choose the entity from the list view.

    2.  Select **Add**.

3.  To create a security incident from the incident record, select **Create Security Incident**.

    **Note:** Verify that the Security Incident Response application is installed in your instance.

    The security incident is created as shown in the example.

4.  To map an entity to the security incident, navigate to Entities related list, select **New**, and follow the substeps.

    1.  Select the entity from the drop-down list to associate with the security incident.

        An entity is added to the security incident; for example, the 'Core Banking Portal' entity is added to SIR0010001.
