# Update the state of the operational vulnerability

Update the state of the Operational vulnerability record to the **Assessment** or **Treatment** state. At this stage, the vulnerability is being evaluated to determine the best course of action and create an action task accordingly.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_oper\_res.manager

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Operational Resilience Workspace** &gt; **All Operational Vulnerabilities**.

2.  Open the vulnerability record from the list.

    The Operational vulnerability record is in the **New** state.

3.  Select **Update state** UI action.

    The **New** state can be transitioned to the following states as shown in the example:

    -   **Assessment**
    -   **Treatment**
    -   **Pending approval**
    -   **Approved**
    -   **Closed**
    -   **Canceled**

    For more information on the state transition model, see [Set up the State model and Action task model](establish-state-model-record.md).

4.  Update the state of the vulnerability record.

    |Step|Description|
    |----|-----------|
    |**Select __Update state__ UI action, select __Assessment__, add comments in __Additional comments__, and select __Submit__.**|This action updates the state of the vulnerability record to the **Assessment** state.|
    |**Select __Update state__ UI action, select __Treatment__, add comments in __Additional comments__, and select __Submit__.**|This action updates the state of the vulnerability record to the **Treatment** state.|

## What to do next

When the vulnerability record is in the **Assessment** state, the task owner creates an assessment-type action task. For more information, see [Manage an assessment-type action task](create-action-task-op-vul.md).

When the vulnerability record is in the **Treatment** state, the task owner creates an investigation-type action task. For more information, see [Manage an investigation-type action task](update-state-of-action-task.md).
