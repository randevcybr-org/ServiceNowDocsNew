# Connect an existing document from Google Drive to policy

Connect a document that exists in your Google Drive folder to a policy that you created. Use this existing document and enable redlining in the policy text instead of creating a document.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_compliance\_ws.corporate\_compliance\_analyst; mp\_document\_user

**Important:** Starting from version 19.1.1 Google documents are supported in the connect document policy.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Compliance Workspace**.

2.  In the Compliance Workspace, select the List icon \(![Lists icon.](../../grc-cam-workspace/image/ws-list-icon.png)\).

3.  Navigate to **Compliance library** &gt; **My policies**.

4.  Select a policy.

5.  Select a Policy text related list to view the contents of the policy.

    If you already have a document on Google Drive with content in it, which you want to associate with the policy, then you can associate that document.

6.  To connect a document that is in your Google Drive folder.

    1.  Navigate to My Drive in [https://drive.google.com/](https://drive.google.com/)

    2.  Select the document that you want to connect to the policy.

    3.  Select the More actions icon \(![More actions icon.](../../../reuse/icons/product-icons/ellipsis-vertical-fill-24.svg)\) in the document that you want to connect.

    4.  Select the **Copy link** option from the **Share** list.

7.  Navigate back to the Policy text tab of the policy record.

8.  Select the **Enable document editing** list.

    The policy must be in **Draft** state, only then the policy owner can associate a document from Google Drive to enable the policy text for the approvers, reviewers, and contributors to edit.

9.  Paste the copied Google Drive in the **File link** field of the Connect existing document pop-up.

10. Select **Connect**.

    You should be able to connect the document from the Google Drive to the policy record.

    **Note:** However, you can’t connect a Google document if it exceeds 10 MB.

11. Select **Update**.

    The Policy text field displays the text from the Google Drive document in the ServiceNow policy record.
