# Assess the impact of a regulatory alert

## About this task

You can initiate one of the following assessments:

-   Regulatory assessment: Uses the Smart Assessment Engine. A regulatory assessment is used to assess the potential effects of new or updated regulations before the regulations are finalized or implemented.
-   Risk assessment: Uses the classic risk assessment. A risk-based approach is used to identify and address both direct and indirect impacts.
