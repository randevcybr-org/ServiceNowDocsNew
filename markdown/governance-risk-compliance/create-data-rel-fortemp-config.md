# Configure the data relationships

Configure the data relationships in the Template Configurations module, which helps you to navigate from a record in the template configuration to any table. When you create these paths, you can fetch necessary data from each of these records in the BCM report template.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_grc\_doc\_design.admin and sn\_bcm.admin

## About this task

When you create data relationships, you can specify how selected records, such as plans to recovery teams or plans to related assets, are connected to the table \(for example, \[sn\_bcp\_plan\]\) in the template relationship registry. You can then establish a path to navigate to these respective records. You can create as many relationships as needed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Business Continuity** &gt; **General Administration** &gt; **Template Configurations**.

2.  In the Template Configurations module, open the template configuration that you created.

3.  In the Data relationships related list, select **New**.

    The Data relationship new record is displayed.

    You can add the source and target relationships.
