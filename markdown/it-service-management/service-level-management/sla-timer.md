# SLA timer

Use the SLA timer component to track the amount of time that is required to complete the task as defined by the matching SLA definition.

The SLA timer component is designed to visually display the current status of the Task SLA. You can also view more information about the task in the tooltip, such as the SLA definition name, the remaining time to breach, and the percentage completed details. When your task is in-schedule, then the tooltip provides extra information, such as the out-of-schedule details.

The timer component can show any of the following stages depending on the current status of the task.
