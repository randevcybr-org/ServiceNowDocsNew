# Request to include a component to a component library

Submit a request for a component in an application that could be reused across multiple applications to be added to a shared component library.

## Before you begin

**Important:** DevOps Config is now deprecated and no longer supported or available for new activation.

Role required: cdm\_admin or cdm\_editor

## About this task

While creating data models for their applications, DevOps Config editors and administrators may identify certain components could be reused across multiple applications. They can submit a request to the component library owners to add those components to the library.

**Note:** You can only submit one request for a component for the same library at a time.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **DevOps Config** &gt; **DevOps Config Workspace**.

2.  Select the apps icon \(![Applications icon.](../image/icon-applications-nav.png)\) in the left navigation to open the **Apps** tab.

3.  Open an application and select the **Config data** tab.

4.  Select the shared components icon \(![Shared components icon.](../image/icon-shared-components-panel.png)\).

    You can see all of your requests from the last 30 days and filter them by their state.

The library owner can review and approve or reject the request.
