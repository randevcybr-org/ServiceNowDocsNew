Supported applications include Microsoft Teams Classic \(macOS\), Google Chrome \(macOS\), Zoom \(macOS and Windows\), Slack \(macOS\), Outlook \(Windows\), and Teams \(Windows\).Use the dex\_action\_app\_config table to add more applications that support this action. Configure the corresponding cache URL to be cleared for each application in the same table. Separate cache URLs by a comma if entering multiple URLs for an app.

**Note:**

-   Select the field auto-close, which closes the application before clearing the cache to confirm all the cache files are cleared.

The predefined actions must be set in the table `dex_jamf_policy` and update the fields Action name, Application, Policy ID, and Active. The detailed information on the fields is listed in the following table.The following are the Jamf limitations:

-   As DEX Admin, you must know the Jamf pro features and have knowledge about the policies configured for applications at the customer Jamf server.
-   Some policies when run, notify the user to update the application instead of automatically updating it. For example, Zoom doesn't automatically update. In cases like these, the policy is executed successfully only if the employee approves the update of the application. Otherwise, the remedial action execution fails.
