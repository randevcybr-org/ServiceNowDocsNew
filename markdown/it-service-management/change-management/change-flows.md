# Change flows

The Change Management Change flows provide a library of reusable actions and end-to-end implementations of the Change models provided in the base system.

Starting with the Yokohama release, the new base system flows replace the existing workflows for Change Management. However, you can continue to create custom workflows or use the existing ones. To migrate your existing workflows to flows, check the new base system flows available in Workflow Studio for guidance. For any new requirements, use flows.

You can use ServiceNow® Workflow Studio to create, operate, and troubleshoot flows. Workflow Studio is a single interface that provides:

-   Natural language descriptions.
-   Runtime information.
-   Consolidated configuration.

The provided flows are read-only to ensure that they can be upgraded. To change the behavior of these flows, make a copy of the read-only flow, and contact Support to deactivate the read-only flow. Deactivating the read-only flow ensures that the copied flow is the only version that is triggered.

If you need to activate the change flows in the base system, you must contact the support to log a case to activate the change flows.

By default, these Change flows are provided:

|Flow|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Change - Cloud Infrastructure - Authorize|Process cloud infrastructure changes for approvals.|
|Change - Emergency - Authorize|Process an emergency change that is in authorize state and is not on hold.|
|Change - Emergency - Implement|Process an emergency change that is in the implement state.|
|Change - Emergency - Review|Process an emergency change in the review state.|
|Change - Normal - Assess|Process a normal change that is in the assess state and is not on hold.|

-   **[Change Management Workflow Studio actions](change-flow-actions.md)**  
Use Workflow Studio actions as building blocks to handle the Change models and types. The flow actions are available under the ITSM spoke in Workflow Studio.
