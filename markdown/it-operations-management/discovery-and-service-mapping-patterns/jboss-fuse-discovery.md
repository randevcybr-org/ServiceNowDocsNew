# Red Hat JBoss Fuse discovery

The ServiceNow Discovery and Service Mapping applications can find and map the Fuse application server using the JBoss Fuse pattern. Discovering some of these resources may require updating to the latest version of the Discovery and Service Mapping Patterns application from the ServiceNow Store.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Prerequisites

-   **Credentials**

    Configure SSH credentials in the Credentials module of the ServiceNow platform for accessing the server hosting the Fuse server.

-   **User**

    Provide a user with the read rights for accessing the following directories:

    -   `$install_directory + "/readme.txt"`

        Access to this directory allows getting version information.

    -   /etc/services

        Access to this directory allows reading the hosts service definition.
