    For example:

    ```

        const labelMap = {
            'em_alert': {
                'alerts_assigned_to_you': {
                    '1': 'Alerts assigned to you - Urgent',
                    '2': 'Alerts assigned to you - High',
                    '3': 'Alerts assigned to you - Moderate',
                    '4': 'Alerts assigned to you - Low'
                },
                'open_alerts': {
                    '1': 'Open alerts - Urgent',
                    '2': 'Open alerts - High',

                'team_alerts_assigned': 'Assigned team alerts - to ',
                'team_alerts_unassigned': {
                    '1': 'Unassigned team alerts - Urgent',
                    '2': 'Unassigned team alerts - High',
