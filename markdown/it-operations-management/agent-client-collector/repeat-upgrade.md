# Repeat high-volume upgrade for failed agents

If high-volume upgrade fails for specific agents, you must clear the problematic agents' history to re-enable upgrade. If the target upgrade version changes, you don't need to clear the agents' history, as the agents upgrade with the next scheduled high-volume upgrade.

## Before you begin

Roles required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

-   In a Windows environment: Local SYSTEM account
-   In a Linux environment: sudo rpm/dpkg
-   In a macOS environment: sudo pkg

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the Agent Client Collectors page **All** &gt; **Agent Client Collector** &gt; **Agents**.

2.  Select an entry for which the **Version** number is not the highest available version.

3.  Locate the **Agent Upgrade Histories** tab.

    ![Agent Upgrade Histories tab](../image/agent-upgrade-histories-tab.png)
