# Upgrade the Agent Client Collector manually on a Windows system

Perform a manual upgrade of your existing Agent Client Collector version on a system running a Windows OS.

## Before you begin

Backup the Agent Client Collector configuration files, such as `acc.yml`, `check-allow-list.json`, `agent_now_id` and `agent_now_keystore`. The `agent_now_id` is located in the cache directory: `C:\ProgramData\Servicenow\agent-client-collector\cache`

Backing up configuration files is a safety precaution to safeguard the files during the upgrade. Configuration files need to be restored only if there are upgrade issues which require new installation.

Enable golden image mode for cloning additional agents by setting the msi property **GOLDEN\_IMAGE=true**.

Role required: agent\_client\_collector\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Select the Windows button on your keyboard and enter **Services** to open the Services page.

2.  Locate the Agent Client Collector service.

3.  Right click the Agent Client Collector service and select **Stop**.

4.  On the Windows Control Panel, select **Uninstall a program**.

5.  Select the Agent Client Collector program and select **Uninstall**.

6.  Navigate to **Agent Client Collector** &gt; **Agent Downloads** and download the MSI Installer in the **Windows Downloads** section.

7.  Install the new agent, as described in [Install the Agent Client Collector on a Windows machine manually](acc-install-windows.md).

    You can use either the manual or single-line procedure. When restoring backup files, the system replaces the configuration file values.

8.  After installation is complete, stop the service.

9.  Restore the `agent_now_id` and `agent_now_keystore` configuration files.

10. Restart the Agent Client Collector service.
