# View discovered service history

The discovered service history shows the frequency of discovered services for a particular time period.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin, evt\_mgmt\_operator, or evt\_mgmt\_user

## About this task

The discovered services history appears only when there are multiple discovered services that occur over a period. A discovered service is a service that is discovered by Service Mapping. The discovered services history is not available for application services. If no discovered services are generated for a particular service, the discovered services history is hidden.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  Click a service tile and click **Service Map**.

3.  Click the **History map** button.

    The history timeline appears, with changes to the service indicated by a clock icon \(![Clock icon](../image/clock-icon.png)\).

    The displayed color corresponds to the discovered services severity, and the length of the bar in each color corresponds to how long the discovered services stayed at that severity.

    The following table explains the severity colors:

    |Severity|Icon color|
    |--------|----------|
    |Critical|Red ![Red icon - Critical severity](../image/red-critical-icon.png)|

    |Minor|Yellow ![Yellow icon - Minor severity](../image/yellow-minor-icon.png)|
    |Warning|Blue ![Blue icon - Warning severity](../image/blue-warning-icon.png)|
