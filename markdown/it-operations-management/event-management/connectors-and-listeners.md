# Configure Event Management connectors

Event Management provides many connectors to pull or push events from external devices. Connectors are available from the ServiceNow store as well as from third parties. You can also create custom connectors.

## Provided connectors \(pull\)

This table lists the connectors that are provided with Event Management.

**Note:**

-   The Azure Metrics and AWS CloudWatch Metrics connectors display in the base system only when the Operational Intelligence plugin \(com.snc.sa.metric\) is activated.
-   All connectors support external credential storage solutions. For details on configuring external credential storage, see [External credential storage configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/connections-and-credentials/external_cred_storage_configuration.md).
