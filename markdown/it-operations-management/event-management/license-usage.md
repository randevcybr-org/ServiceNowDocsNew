# View Event Management license usage

Event Management is licensed based on the number of CIs bound to alerts during the last year. For alerts that are not bound to CIs, the system calculates the number of nodes \(servers\) that can send events to the instance directly or through a third-party monitoring tool during the last year.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_admin or evt\_mgmt\_operator

## About this task

The **Event Management - Node Count Store** job calculates the number of unique nodes that send event information, either directly or through third-parties, to Event Management and are eligible for licensing in the last year. The information from this job is stored in the License Usage \[em\_unique\_nodes\] table for visibility by all users. CIs bound to alerts are counted towards licensing; if there are no CIs that are bound to alerts, the event node field is used. Node is a reference to a server, not the instances of the software on it. Your node count is based on the amount of infrastructure \(servers for example\) that will be sending events.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Reporting** &gt; **License Usage**.

    The table is filled automatically based on the alerts in the system. The user has no permission to edit the table. It is used to calculate the usage of the Event Management licensing.
