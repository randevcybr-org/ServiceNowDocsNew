# Launch a web application from an alert

As an Event Management operator, you can also launch a web application from an alert. The web application might be a console for the event monitoring tool that your organization uses, or any external website that provides additional information you might need about the alert.

## Before you begin

**Note:** The Operator Workspace interface is available only to customers who have upgraded from a release prior to the Utah release. New customers as of the Utah release can use the Service Operations Workspace for ITOM, which offers an enhanced UI for managing alerts.

You can launch a web application if your administrator has set up a link to the application. You should be familiar with your organization’s policies on triaging alerts.

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  From the Service Operations Workspace dashboard, open the alert that you acknowledged in Phase 1: Analyze and acknowledge an alert.

2.  On the Alert form, click **Quick Response**.

3.  In the Quick Response window, click the name of the application under **Launch Application**.

    Your administrator has specified which applications should appear in the list.

## What to do next

There are also other tasks you can take as part of the triage stage:

-   [Run a remediation workflow on an alert](operator-run-remdiation.md) if your Event Management administrator already set up a workflow in your ServiceNow instance and your policies allow you to trigger it from the alert.
-   [Put an alert into maintenance](operator-put-alert-into-maintenance.md) to temporarily hide it from the Service Operations Workspace dashboard if the alert does not require action at this time.
-   [Associate a knowledge base article with an alert](operator-associate-kb.md) if there is existing information about the alert that might help resolve the underlying issue.

If you do not need to perform any other triage actions, proceed to [Phase 3: Close an alert](operator-close-alert.md).
