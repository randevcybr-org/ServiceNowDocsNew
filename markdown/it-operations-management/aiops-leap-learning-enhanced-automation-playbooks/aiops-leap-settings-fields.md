# LEAP settings fields

LEAP settings page field values help estimate cost and time savings when automation is used. These settings support cost predictability with the fixed pricing model.

## LEAP settings fields

<table><thead><tr><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Cost per work note \($\)

</td><td>

This value represents the cost for each work note that also includes labor and operational expenses for every incident.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Time per work note \(hrs\)

</td><td>

This value is the average time spent on each work note entry used to estimate the total time impact across incidents.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Overhead factor for P1 records

</td><td>

Overhead factors are multipliers that are used for high-priority incidents and represent hidden costs. Priority 1 incidents often require more coordination, communication, and escalation — beyond just the direct work notes. For P1 incidents, the base cost is multiplied by 1.8 to reflect the additional impact.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Overhead factor for P2 records

</td><td>

Overhead factors are multipliers that are used for high-priority incidents and represent hidden costs. For priority 2 incidents, the base cost is multiplied by 1.4 to reflect the additional impact.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Overhead factor for P3 records

</td><td>

Overhead factors are multipliers that are used for high-priority incidents and represent hidden costs. For priority 3 incidents, the base cost is multiplied by 1.1 to reflect the additional impact.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Overhead factor for P4 records

</td><td>

Overhead factors are multipliers that are used for high-priority incidents and represent hidden costs. For priority 4, the base cost is multiplied by 0.8 to reflect the additional impact.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Overhead factor for P5 records

</td><td>

Overhead factors are multipliers that are used for high-priority incidents and represent hidden costs. For priority 5, the base cost is multiplied by 0.4 to reflect the additional impact.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Large group size

</td><td>

Groups that have incidents more than the threshold set are marked as large groups. The default value set is 200 incidents.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Number of pinned groups

</td><td>

This value specifies the number of groups that can be pinned for tracking.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Groups with resolution steps in initial run

</td><td>

This value specifies the number of groups for which resolution steps are generated in the first run of LEAP.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Minimum incident-to-group ratio for remapping eligibility

</td><td>

LEAP can remap incidents to better groups when improved patterns are observed. This ratio determines the minimum incident-to-group size needed for remapping eligibility. Higher values means more selective remapping.
