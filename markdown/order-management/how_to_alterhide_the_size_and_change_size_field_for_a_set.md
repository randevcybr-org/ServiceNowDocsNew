# Modifying the Size and Change Size fields for a set

You can change the appearance of the size fields for a set, or hide them altogether.

![User interface](../images/cpq-sets-size-and-change-size-fields.png)

You can hide these fields by making an adjustment in the layout of the blueprint. In the layout editor, click the gear icon next to the set:

In the size settings, you can choose to show or hide the set size field, as well as the appearance, location, and behavior of the field:

An admin can also hide the size field by modifying the Set type value column in the layout CSV file. Enter the following:

```
{ "sizeControl": { "visible": false } }
```

For more information about how to control the size and behavior of sets, see [Using sets in layouts](layouts-sets.md).
