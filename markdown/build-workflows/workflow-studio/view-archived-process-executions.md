# View archived process contexts

Configure the form layout for a process execution so that you can see the JSON record for archived context records.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or playbook.admin

## About this task

To view the archived context records for a process execution record, you must configure the Form Layout for process execution records. If you haven't archived any context records for a process execution and want to, see [Archive process contexts](archive-process-executions.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All**, and enter **sys\_pd\_context.list** in the Filter field to open the \[sys\_pd\_context\] table.

2.  Open any process execution.

3.  Open the form context menu \(![Context menu icon](../../form-administration/image/ContextMenu.png)\).

4.  Select **Configure** &gt; **Form Layout**.

5.  In the Available list, double-click **Archive** to move it to the **Selected** list.

6.  Select **Save**.

    The Archive field appears in all process execution records.

7.  Open a process execution with archived process context records.

    You can view the JSON record of the archived context records for the process execution in the Archive field.
