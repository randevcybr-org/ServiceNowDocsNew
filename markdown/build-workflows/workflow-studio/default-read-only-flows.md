# Default read-only flows

Open existing flows in a read-only state to protect them from accidental changes. While a flow is in a read-only state, you can only review, test, deactivate, or request to edit it.

## Request to edit flow

As of the Washington DC release, you must request to edit an existing flow before you can change it. If you don't have permission to edit a flow, the Edit flow button remains disabled.

When you request to edit a flow, Workflow Studio checks whether another person already has the flow open for edit. If the flow is available for editing, you open the flow in an editable state. If the flow is already being edited, you see a message displaying the name of the user editing the flow.

## Stop editing a flow

Flows remain in an editable state until one of these events occur.

-   You close the Workflow Studio flow tab.
-   You close the Workflow Studio browser tab.
-   You select the **Make flow read only** option.
-   You remain inactive in the flow for more than 30 minutes.

When you're done editing a flow, you can make it read only so that other people can edit it. You can use the **Make flow read only** option to stop editing a flow.
