## Create a template using Flow Template Builder

Create template from a flow in Workflow Studio to guide flow authors through the creation of a flow with the same configuration and customized template input values for the components.

### Before you begin

-   Activate the App Engine Studio \(sn\_app\_eng\_studio\) and [Flow Template Builder \(sn\_flow\_template\)](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/dfe6fd01594b70605a943e33c8087226) plugins.
-   Create a flow in Workflow Studio as per your requirement.

2.  In Workflow Studio, open the required flow.

3.  Click the more actions icon \(![More actions icon.](../images/MoreActionsIcon.png)\) and select **Save flow as a template**.

## Create a flow from a template in App Engine Studio

    **Note:** If the template is modified, the template must be activated again for the changes to be reflected in App Engine Studio.

-   Role required: Template Runner

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **App Engine Studio**.

2.  In **My recent apps**, select the required app.

    After providing the required inputs, a confirmation message is displayed that the flow is created.

8.  To edit the flow in Workflow Studio, click **Edit this flow**.

    The flow is opened in Workflow Studio.

    **Note:**

    -   Avoid editing flows that are created from a template. If you intend to edit the flow, ensure that you test the flow before publishing it.
    -   In App Engine Studio, template inputs are not displayed in the same order as you had created in Workflow Studio. In this example, order in which fields appear in App Engine Studio is different from the order in which inputs are configured in Workflow Studio.

        ![Order of fields in Workflow Studio.](../images/ft-order.png "Input fields configured in Workflow Studio")

        ![Order of fields in App Engine Studio.](../images/ft-aes-order.png "Input fields displayed in App Engine Studio")

        **Note:** To configure the order in which fields are displayed in App Engine Studio and modify the displayed text such as title and heading, navigate to Template Wizards by typing `sys_app_template_wizard.list` in the left navigator pane and configure your template wizard as per your requirement.
