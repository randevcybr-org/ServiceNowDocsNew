# Phase 3 - Verify your upgrade configurations and schedule the development instance upgrade in Now Support

Check the configuration of the **Check distribution for possible upgrade** scheduled job to view how often and when it runs. Review information about timing your upgrade in coordination with the **Check distribution for possible upgrade** scheduled job. Then, schedule your upgrade in Now Support.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin.

You must check the configuration of the **Check distribution for possible upgrade** and **Check database for possible upgrade** sys\_triggers, which are essential to making sure your instance upgrades to the correct target version.

**Note:** Starting in the Paris release, 'Upgrade' job has been renamed to 'Check distribution for possible upgrade'. In addition, the 'Check Upgrade Script' job has been renamed to 'Check database for possible upgrade'.

-   Queries Now Support to ask whether an upgrade is going to happen in a given time interval, which is determined by the configuration for the **Check distribution for possible upgrade** scheduled job.
-   Asks whether the instance should be running a different version. If so, the distribution for that version is downloaded, and your instance upgrades to the target version.

</table>## About this task

**Important:** Your upgrades are orchestrated out of your instance, not Now Support.

Now Support keeps records of what version you should be running, and your instance periodically queries Now Support to check its assigned version. When you designate a time for your upgrade, your instance begins the upgrade at that time. For example:

|Action|Result|
|------|------|
|You schedule an upgrade to Australia Patch 8 to take place on June 10 at 3:00pm.|Now Support changes its records to reflect that you should be on Australia Patch 8 on June 10 at 3:00pm.|
|Now Support waits to get pinged by your instance after the scheduled time on June 10.|Your instance continues to operate on its current release version, and it periodically pings Now Support.|
|After the scheduled time on June 10, Now Support receives a ping from your instance.|Now Support tells your instance that it should be on Australia Patch 8.|
|Your instance receives a Now Support notification that it should be running a different version.|Your instance starts the upgrade.|

        If the version does require an entitlement, this screen appears:

        **Note:** Setting the time for an upgrade or patch is important. Set the upgrade or patch to start 10–15 minutes before the **Check distribution for possible upgrade** scheduled job runs. This setting allows enough time for the upgrade or patch request to update Now Support 's records about which release version your instance should be on before the **Check distribution for possible upgrade** scheduled job runs.

        A confirmation message appears. If you need an entitlement, the entitlement request number is included. Click the entitlement request number to view the request.
