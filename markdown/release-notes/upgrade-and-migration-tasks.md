The following changes are taking place in the Australia release in preparation for a full deprecation of GlideEncrypter/3DES in the future:
    -   New Australia instances can’t use GlideEncrypter. All base system scripts have been changed to use alternative encryption processes.
    -   if you’re upgrading your Australia instances, you can still GlideEncrypter, which has been updated to use AES256-GCM encryption via the Key Management Framework.

MID Server

For the latest MID Server system requirements, see [MID Server system requirements](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=r_MIDServerSystemRequirements&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US). The minimum JRE version supported is 17.0.10 and the recommended version is 21.0.7.

 If you have installed your own JRE, the upgrade process takes the following actions to verify that the MID Server uses a supported JRE:

-   If a MID Server is using an unsupported version of the JRE when it upgrades, the upgrade process displays a warning message with the minimum and recommended JRE version.
-   If a supported JRE is running on the MID Server host, the upgraded MID Server uses that version.

 All MID Server host machines require access to the download site at `install.service-now.com` to enable auto-upgrades. For additional details, read how the system manages [MID Server upgrades](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_UpgradeAndTestMIDServer&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

 Only one Windows MID Server service is permitted according to the executable path. Upgraded Windows MID Servers that have multiple services pointing to the same installation folder can’t start. See [MID Server fails to start](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mid-startup-fails&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US) for more information.

If this property doesn't exist in the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table, add the property and set its value to false. For more information on how to add a property, see [Add a system property](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

 After you upgrade to Australia, the bot process definitions change to the new structure, which is the bot process configuration.

 Although the bot process configuration doesn't replace the bot process completely, most fields are moved from the bot process to the bot process configuration. If you upgrade to Australia without updating the system property value, the tables don’t extend the Application File \[sys\_metadata\] table. To update the table changes manually, see the [Restructuring RPA Hub tables to sys\_metadata in Utah and beyond release \[KB1223629\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1223629) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Service Exchange \(formerly Service Bridge\)

</td><td>

**Important:** Do not upgrade your ServiceNow® instance to the Australia release if you rely on Service Exchange. A known RPS issue prevents Service Exchange from functioning correctly. Proceed with the upgrade only after Australia Patch 1 becomes available.

-   Service Exchange version 2.x.x, which was first released with the Xanadu release, doesn’t support migration of Service Exchange \(Legacy\) versions.

Service Exchange \(Legacy\) version: Before you upgrade to the Australia release, consult the [Service Exchange for Providers \(Legacy\) - Migration Utility \[KB1499823\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1499823) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base to find out how to migrate your configuration data.

-   Service Exchange version 1.x.x: When upgrading, consult the [Upgrade Guide - Service Exchange for Providers and Consumers application \(v2.x.x release\) \[KB1700387\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1700387) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base to find out how to migrate your Service Exchange applications.
-   Service Exchange version 2.x.x: New entitlements that require the latest compatibility version cannot be activated until both consumers and providers upgrade to Service Exchange version 2.x.x. New entitlements configured with a lower compatibility version can be activated. Older active entitlements continue to work but new ones can’t be activated.
-   When using Service Exchange for Providers and Service Exchange for Consumers in a single instance, you must upgrade both applications simultaneously to the same version to maintain compatibility. If the versions diverge, a scan check will report version mismatches and the Health Dashboard will show a version mismatch issue. After upgrading, run and validate the post‑upgrade scan suite to identify and resolve any post‑upgrade issues.
-   If you have upgraded to Service Exchange version 2.0.55 before upgrading the platform to the Australia release and your instance has Sales Customer Relationship Management plug-in version 1.0.4 installed, the new Deny ACLs aren't installed. After upgrading to the Australia release, select Repair to reinstall the Service Exchange application to ensure Deny ACLs are installed.
-   When you install the Service Exchange application, the Service Exchange Global script include is automatically installed or updated on the following platform versions:
    -   Yokohama

If you’re a VRM user upgrading to TPRM and upgrading to Australia from an earlier release, you must run each upgrade sequentially to ensure that fix scripts run correctly. For example, you must upgrade from Xanadu to Yokohama, Yokohama to Zurich, and so on. If the scripts don’t run in the correct order, you can get data inconsistencies, broken functionalities, and conflicts.

 After upgrading to version 21.0.x, you can enable the Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) by setting the Smart Assessment Engine enabled \(**sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.sae\_enabled**\) property. After setting this property, Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) becomes the default assessment engine and replaces the legacy experience. The transition isn’t reversible.

**Warning:**

Set this property in your non-production instances and conduct thorough testing before changing your production instances. Failure to do so may result in unexpected issues.

 For more information on upgrading from VRM to TPRM and the differences between the Smart and Classic Assessment engines, see [Third-party Risk Management upgrade information](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=grc-tprm-upgrade-info&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

 For existing TPRM customers, after upgrading to version 21.0.3, data from the Industry column in the Company \[core\_company\] table is automatically migrated to the tprm\_industry column. Migration can take several hours depending on the number of records in the Company \[core\_company\] table. After migration, a system log message confirms that the migration is complete. Review the Company \[core\_company\] table content and update any customizations referencing the Industry field to use tprm\_industry. After verifying the migration and updating customizations, you can drop the Industry column.

[Washington DC Patch 9](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=washingtondc-patch-9&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US):

-   After you upgrade to Washington DC Patch 9 from an earlier release, make knowledge block content searchable by reindexing all your indexed sources that include knowledge articles. For details on reindexing, see [Index or reindex an indexed source](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=index-single-source-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) or [Index or reindex multiple indexed sources](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=index-multiple-sources-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

 Washington DC:

-   When you upgrade to Washington DC, AI Search automatically updates your existing Genius Result configurations to use the new [AI Search Genius Result Configuration form](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=genius-result-cfg-form-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) fields. This update procedure makes the following changes:
    -   Removes existing **Genius result answer type** field values.
    -   Migrates **Genius result logic** field values to the new **AI Search request processor** and **AI Search response processor** fields as appropriate.
-   After you upgrade your instance to Washington DC, AI Search retains the value that you previously set for the **Boolean search operator to use when a search query includes multiple terms** \(**glide.ais.query.search\_operator**\) system property. To gain the benefits of the new enhanced query mode for multi-term searches, set this system property's value to **AND then OR 2+ key terms**. For details on AI Search system properties, see [AI Search system properties](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=system-properties-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).
-   Starting in Washington DC, the User \[sys\_user\] table defaults to sorting indexed records by their sys\_created\_on dates instead of sorting them by their sys\_updated\_on dates. This change requires reindexing of the User table indexed source for AI Search, which can be time-consuming. When you upgrade to Washington DC from a previous family release, AI Search does not automatically reindex the User table indexed source. If you need to be able to search the latest configuration for user records, you can [manually reindex](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=index-single-source-ais&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US) the User table indexed source, which may take some time. Otherwise, AI Search will reindex individual User table records as they're updated until all records have been reindexed.

When you select the **Update dependencies** button, the system adds the CMDB dependencies.
-   For business continuity plans, the Source column is renamed to Primary source following an upgrade. When you select the **Update dependencies** button, the system adds the CMDB and BIA dependencies. To maintain compatibility with the previous releases, the BCM administrator can configure the sources and keep only the BIA upstream dependency and BIA downstream dependencies as the sources in the updated configuration.
-   For events and exercises, when you select the **Update dependencies** button, the system adds the CMDB, BIA, and Business Continuity Planning \(BCP\) dependencies after an upgrade. To maintain compatibility with the previous releases, the BCM administrator can configure the sources and keep only the BIA upstream dependency and BIA downstream dependencies as the sources in the updated configuration.

Core ServiceNow AI Platform

</td><td>

Previously, if a transaction was canceled, certain auditable operations were not being recorded. This behavior of missing audit records is because the platform executes some operations between the record change and is canceled before audit creation. But now, audits are created immediately after the record is changed, reducing the chance of a canceled transaction aborting the operation before the audit is recorded. To facilitate this update, audits are now recorded in the same thread as the transaction. Earlier audits were created in a background thread.

 This change redefines the default value of the `glide.db.audit.lazy` property from true to false. Ideally, this property is not defined in the Properties table, which means that the majority of instances start using the new default value and behavior with the Washington DC release. On some instances, this property may have been inserted with the value set to true, which means that these instances won’t be able to use this change to audit behavior. Delete this property to leverage this update.

 Note the following upgrade scenarios for the Total Cost of Ownership \(TCO\) of assets:

-   Upgrade works for all Enterprise Asset Management flow tasks
-   You must have task rate cards for each workflow task.
-   The TCO upgrade populates the **Asset** and **Expense category** fields on expense lines corresponding to each task.
-   Expense category is populated based on the expense lines and the source of the expense line.
-   You need to populate the TCO benchmark cost and the TCO benchmark threshold field on all existing models manually or using the bulk import functionality.
-   TCO upgrade populates following fields on asset forms:
    -   **Asset end of useful life**: The created date plus the useful life in months.
    -   **Asset first used date**: The created date.
    -   **Asset TCO**: The aggregated sum of all the expense lines related to the asset. For simple assets, Asset TCO is the aggregated sum of expense lines under it. For complex assets, Asset TCO is the aggregated sum of expense lines of the parent as well as its child assets.

-   Healthcare Organization\[sn\_hcls\_organization\]
-   Healthcare Location\[sn\_hcls\_location\]
-   Practitioner Location\[sn\_hcls\_practitioner\_facility\]

This reparenting enables customers to use the organizations and location tables for a broader set of use cases.

 Existing data is migrated in the following manner so that existing functionality isn’t impacted:

1.  Reference of location field in sn\_hcls\_immunization updated to use cmn\_location.
2.  All data is moved from Healthcare Sold Product to Install Base Item tables.
3.  Rows in the affected Install Base Item are populated based on the source\_task value from the Healthcare Sold Product.
4.  The state of sn\_hcls\_enrolled\_program and sn\_hcls\_enrolled\_program\_service are copied from hcls\_state.
5.  All data moves to the standalone tables of Healthcare Organization, Healthcare Location, and Practitioner Location.
    1.  The script creates records in the Business Location table for existing records in the Healthcare Organization table to form a 1:1 reference.
    2.  Records that refer to a service organization are updated with a reference to the appropriate business location.
    3.  Any practitioner who has a record in the practitioner location will have a record created in the Service Organization Member table with the appropriate business location.
    4.  Records that contain healthcare location data will contain the parent service organization of that healthcare location.

For more information, see [Download the RPA applications from RPA Hub](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=download-installer-rpa&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

 The following upgrade steps are applicable only when you’re upgrading from San Diego or Tokyo to Washington DC.

 Based on the number of records in the application file table, you could experience a potential delay while upgrading the RPA Hub applications from Tokyo or before to Washington DC.

 Before upgrading RPA Hub to Washington DC, you must set the value of the **glide.rollback.blacklist.TableParentChange.change** system property to **false**. If this property doesn't exist in the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table, add the property and set its value to false. For more information on how to add a property, see [Add a system property](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

 After you upgrade to the Washington DC, the bot process definitions change to the new structure, which is the bot process configuration.

 Although the bot process configuration doesn't replace the bot process completely, most fields are moved from bot process to bot process configuration. If you upgrade to the Utah version without updating the system property value, the tables don’t extend the Application File table. To update the table changes manually, see the [Restructuring RPA Hub tables to sys\_metadata in Utah](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1223629) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Service Portal

</td><td>

After upgrading, you must specify the tables from which guest users can access data for any public widgets that accept the table input parameter. By default in the Washington DC release, public widgets that accept the table input parameter can't access and return data from any tables for guest users. If you added the **glide.service\_portal.widget.table\_allow\_list** or **glide.service\_portal.widget.allow\_list** system properties before upgrading, the values of these properties will be migrated to the Public Table Allow List for widgets after upgrading. For more information, see [Configure widget security](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-widget-security&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

 Additionally, field-level read ACLs are enforced for filter conditions in Simple List widget instances by default. A new system property, **glide.service\_portal.enable\_acls\_for\_encoded\_query\_in\_list**, enforces these ACLs regardless of whether the **Enforce field-level Read ACLs on Filter query terms** option is selected for Simple List widget instances. To use the **Enforce field-level Read ACLs on Filter query terms** option, change the value of **glide.service\_portal.enable\_acls\_for\_encoded\_query\_in\_list** to false. For more information, see [Simple List widget](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=simple-list-widget&family=washingtondc&ft:locale=en-US).

 If a user previously selected a user consent preference for user experience analytics for portals different from the rest of the platform, the preference selected for the platform is also used for portals in the Washington DC release. For example, if users opted out of tracking for portals but opted in to tracking for the rest of the platform in the Vancouver release, user experience analytics for portals are tracked for them in the Washington DC release. Users can update their selection from the user profile page in portals at any time.

 However, you will see both the Source-to-Pay Workspace and Supplier Manager Workspace on the **Workspaces** tab. If you want to use the Supplier Manager Workspace instead of the default Source-to-Pay Workspace, ensure that you run the `fixscript_migrate_workspace_to_smw.xml` fix script after upgrading to the Washington DC release. You can download the `fixscript_migrate_workspace_to_smw.xml` file from the ServiceNow Store.

 If you want to revert to using the Source-to-Pay Workspace, run the `fixscript_migrate_workspace_to_s2p.xml` fix script.

-   Before the upgrade to Xanadu, the ‘Updated CIs’ and ‘Updated application services’ trend lines in the Recent CI activity and Recent application services activities tiles on the Management view in CMDB Workspace, might not have accurately reflected on changes in your system. After upgrading to Xanadu and to versions 5.5, 6.2, or 7.2 of CMDB Workspace, those trend lines will reflect on the more accurate detection of updated CIs and updated application services.
-   CMDB Health:

If either the **CMDB Health Dashboard - Relationship Compliance Processor** or **CMDB Health Dashboard - Relationship Score Calculation** dashboard job is active, that job is deactivated during the upgrade to Xanadu. After the upgrade is complete, you can reactivate those jobs to resume health reports for CI relationships. The active state of all other CMDB Health dashboard jobs is retained.

Any failure threshold for a KPI or metric that is greater than 100,000, is set to 100,000 during upgrade. This upper limit is enforced to avoid excessive processing when a large number of CIs are failing the specified metric tests.

-   Bookmarks for the CI dashboard no longer work after an upgrade to Xanadu. A `Page not found` error message appears. To see CMDB Health reports for a CI, open the CI form in CMDB Workspace.
-   The legacy Application Service Dashboard on Core UI isn't supported in the Xanadu release. After upgrading, you can still access that legacy dashboard by using a previously created bookmark. You can also instead access the Application Services dashboard in CMDB Workspace from the Application services tile in the Insights view in CMDB Workspace.

For more information, see [Download the RPA applications from RPA Hub](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=download-installer-rpa&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

 The following upgrade information is applicable only when you’re upgrading from San Diego or Tokyo to Xanadu.

 Based on the number of records in the application file table, you could experience a potential delay while upgrading the RPA Hub applications from Tokyo or earlier releases to Xanadu.

 Before upgrading RPA Hub to Xanadu, you must set the value of the **glide.rollback.blacklist.TableParentChange.change** system property to **false**. If this property doesn't exist in the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table, add the property and set its value to false. For more information on how to add a property, see [Add a system property](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

 After you upgrade to Xanadu, the bot process definitions change to the new structure, which is the bot process configuration.

 Although the bot process configuration doesn't replace the bot process completely, most fields are moved from the bot process to the bot process configuration. If you upgrade to Xanadu without updating the system property value, the tables don’t extend the Application File table.

To force semantic vector indexing of your external content items as soon as possible after upgrading, cancel any running crawls, then restart the canceled crawls manually.

 When you upgrade to version 4 of the External Content Connectors application from an earlier version, searches may not show all previously crawled content until you've completed both a content crawl and a user mapping crawl for each upgraded connector. The first content crawl run after the upgrade will reindex all searchable content from the source system, and the user mapping crawl will reindex all security principals from the source system. All crawled content should be shown in searches after both of these crawls are complete.

 If you have installed your own JRE, the upgrade process takes the following actions to verify that the MID Server uses a supported JRE:

-   If a MID Server is using an unsupported version of the JRE when it upgrades, the upgrade process displays a warning message with the minimum and recommended JRE version.
-   If a supported JRE is running on the MID Server host, the upgraded MID Server uses that version.

Product Catalog Management and Pricing Management

</td><td>

After upgrading to the May 2025 release of Sales Customer Relationship Management applications, you must run a scheduled job that automatically enables the **Allow multiple configurations** option when your catalog admin creates product offerings with an associated product specification. This job is called **Scheduled job with an upgrade script to set 'allow\_multiple\_configurations' to true on an Offering**. When multiple product offering configurations are allowed in configurable opportunities, quotes, or orders, agents can create multiple instances of a child product offering and define custom configurations for each offering instance.

**Note:** The **Allow multiple configurations** option is always enabled \(set to true\) for all product offerings that have an associated product specification. However, if the product specification has a child hierarchy, this option is honored only for orders placed through the TMF APIs. For specifications without a hierarchy, the flag is honored across all ordering channels.

 The May 2025 release provides a default pricing plan that includes a new step, Apply Renewal Adjustment. If you've been using a custom pricing plan from an earlier release, review the default pricing plan, which is in a Retired state after upgrading to the May 2025 release. Determine whether you want to publish the default plan or customize the default pricing plan for your needs and then publish the custom plan to be used.

For more information, see [Download the RPA applications from RPA Hub](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=download-installer-rpa&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

 The following upgrade information is applicable only when you’re upgrading from San Diego or Tokyo to Yokohama.

 Based on the number of records in the application file table, you may experience a delay while upgrading the RPA Hub applications from Tokyo or earlier releases to Yokohama.

 Before upgrading RPA Hub to Yokohama, you must set the value of the **glide.rollback.blacklist.TableParentChange.change** system property to **false**. If this property doesn't exist in the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table, add the property and set its value to false. For more information on how to add a property, see [Add a system property](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

 After you upgrade to Yokohama, the bot process definitions change to the new structure, which is the bot process configuration.

 Although the bot process configuration doesn't replace the bot process completely, most fields are moved from the bot process to the bot process configuration. If you upgrade to Yokohama without updating the system property value, the tables don’t extend the Application File \[sys\_metadata\] table. To update the table changes manually, see the [Restructuring RPA Hub tables to sys\_metadata in Utah and beyond release \[KB1223629\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1223629) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

To force semantic vector indexing of your external content items as soon as possible after upgrading, cancel any running crawls, then restart the canceled crawls manually.

 When you upgrade to version 4 of the External Content Connectors application from an earlier version, searches may not show all previously crawled content until you've completed both a content crawl and a user mapping crawl for each upgraded connector. The first content crawl run after the upgrade will reindex all searchable content from the source system, and the user mapping crawl will reindex all security principals from the source system.

MID Server

</td><td>

For the latest MID Server system requirements, see [MID Server system requirements](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=r_MIDServerSystemRequirements&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US). The minimum JRE version supported is 17.0.10 and the recommended version is 17.0.12.

 If you have installed your own JRE, the upgrade process takes the following actions to verify that the MID Server uses a supported JRE:

-   If a MID Server is using an unsupported version of the JRE when it upgrades, the upgrade process displays a warning message with the minimum and recommended JRE version.
-   If a supported JRE is running on the MID Server host, the upgraded MID Server uses that version.

 All MID Server host machines require access to the download site at `install.service-now.com` to enable auto-upgrades. For additional details, read how the system manages [MID Server upgrades](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_UpgradeAndTestMIDServer&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

 Only one Windows MID Server service is permitted according to the executable path. Upgraded Windows MID Servers that have multiple services pointing to the same installation folder can’t start. See [MID Server fails to start](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mid-startup-fails&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US) for more information.

-   Join conference call
-   Call
-   Send SMS
-   Forward call
-   Input
-   Hangup
-   Play
-   Record
-   Reject
-   Say
-   Forward to notify client

 The Zurich release introduces enhanced protections for read‑only fields across the ServiceNow® AI Platform. These changes include a new “read\_only\_option” field with granular control levels, including “strict\_read\_only” and “client\_script\_modifiable". The changes occur in the back-end and maintain backward‑compatible behavior. This update helps strengthen your instance security while preserving the flexibility you need. If you have custom client scripts that modify ServiceNow® ‑owned read‑only fields using `g_form.setValue()` or `g_form.clearValue()`, refer to [KB2718122](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2718122). This article provides additional technical details on how to identify affected fields and adjust their settings.

 The existing Access Control Lists \(ACLs\) will be updated to replace the 'admin' role with specific, purpose-driven granular roles within scripts or security attributes. As part of this update, the `getRoles()` API will be replaced with the `hasRole()` API for authorization purposes. Additionally, all references to the 'admin' role in the code will be substituted with the new feature-specific granular roles for authorization use cases.

Pricing Management v15.0.0 provides a default pricing plan that includes new steps to support pricing strategies introduced in this release. If you're using a custom pricing plan from an earlier release, review the default pricing plan, which is in a Retired state after you upgrade. Determine whether you want to publish the default plan or customize the default pricing plan for your needs. The default plan contains new steps for calculating net pricing and roll-up values for configurable products in quotes and orders: Net Price Calculation, Line Rollup, and Header Rollup steps. This pricing functionality existed in previous releases for quotes and orders but wasn’t included in the default pricing plan. To retain this previous functionality for quotes and orders, you must add the Net Price Calculation, Line Rollup, and Header Rollup steps in your custom pricing plan before you publish it for use.

 If you used the legacy product configurator previously and want to use the CPQ Configurator, after upgrading set the **sn\_prd\_pm.enable\_advanced\_configuration** system property to true. When set to true, this property enables the CPQ Configurator.

 If you want to use AI Search for product catalog searches, before upgrading install Now Assist for Sales Force Automation \(SFA\), which includes the plugins needed for AI Search functionality. After upgrading, complete various steps to implement AI Search. These steps include running a scheduled job to set up AI Search and enabling AI Search in the product catalog interface by setting the **enable\_ai\_search\_in\_catalog** system property to true.

Starting from the Zurich release, the following workflows are migrated to Flow Designer as flows:

-   Reclamation workflow
-   Procurement Process Flow - Auto allocation enabled

When upgrading to the Zurich release, a fix script identifies whether the workflows were customized. If you haven't customized the workflows before the upgrade, the fix script deactivates the legacy workflows from the instance and deploys the Flow Designer flows on the instance post-upgrade. If you have customized the impacted workflows in the previous release, the fix script doesn’t deploy the Flow Designer flows on the instance post-upgrade. You can view and access the impacted workflows in the instance after the upgrade. However, the deprecated workflows are considered as custom code and ServiceNow doesn’t support those workflows.

 Starting from the Zurich release, the Software Asset Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\) is moved from the family release to the Software Asset Workspace store application. After upgrading to Zurich, the Software Asset Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\) is inactivated and the Software Asset Workspace store application \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) is enabled in the instance.

 When upgrading to the Software Asset Management – SaaS License Management plugin \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) version 16.0.6 or later in the Zurich release, verify that the Software Asset Workspace store app \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) is updated to version 9.0.4.

Third-party Risk Management

</td><td>

If you’re a VRM user upgrading to TPRM and upgrading to Vancouver or a later release from an earlier release, you must run each upgrade sequentially to ensure that fix scripts run correctly. For example, you must upgrade from Utah to Vancouver, Vancouver to Washington DC, and so on. If the scripts don’t run in the correct order, you can get data inconsistencies, broken functionalities, and conflicts.

After upgrading to version 21.0.x, you can enable the Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) by setting the Smart Assessment Engine enabled \(**sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.sae\_enabled**\) property. After setting this property, Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) becomes the default assessment engine and replaces the legacy experience. The transition isn’t reversible.

**Warning:**

Set this property in your non-production instances and conduct thorough testing before changing your production instances. Failure to do so may result in unexpected issues.

For more information on upgrading from VRM to TPRM and the differences between the Smart and Classic Assessment engines, see [Third-party Risk Management upgrade information](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=grc-tprm-upgrade-info&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

For existing TPRM customers, after upgrading to version 21.0.3, data from the Industry column in the Company \[core\_company\] table is automatically migrated to the tprm\_industry column. Migration can take several hours depending on the number of records in the Company \[core\_company\] table. After migration, a system log message confirms that the migration is complete. Review the Company \[core\_company\] table content and update any customizations referencing the Industry field to use tprm\_industry. After verifying the migration and updating customizations, you can drop the Industry column.

If you're currently using Vulnerability Response, and you do not intend to upgrade to Unified Security Exposure Management \(USEM\), install a version below v30.x of Vulnerability Response and for upgrades to supported third-party integration applications.

 The Missing Assets \[sn\_vul\_wiz\_missing\_asset\] table used for storing assets imported by the backfill integrations for the [Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=vr-wiz-exploring-host-cf&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US) is deprecated. If you're currently using the Vulnerability Response with Wiz integrations, after updating to new version 1.1, you must backdate any of your existing Wiz primary integrations by three days and run them. Review more information about the Wiz integration at [SecOps articles on the Security Operations Community](https://www.servicenow.com/community/secops-articles/announcement-wiz-integration-with-servicenow-secops/ta-p/3325055).
