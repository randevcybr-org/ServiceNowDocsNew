JavaScript popups \(alert, confirm, prompt\) should be limited in use

Users may become frustrated with the tool with all the popups.

Use OOB methods such as **g\_form.addInfoMessage**\(\) and **g\_form.showFieldMsg**\(\) to display information to the user without popups. **GlideDialogWindow** is another method that can be utilized if we need to gather data from the user which doesn't reside on the form.

Child group does not contain all parent roles

Process delays due to insufficient access.

Review this group to understand why the roles have not been inherited from the parent group. Potential causes to this issue include business rules that did not execute, a clone that excludes the Group Role \[**sys\_group\_has\_role**\] table, or if roles have been deleted directly from the Group Role \[**sys\_group\_has\_role**\] table. Removing the parent from this group, saving, and then adding the parent back should resolve this issue.
