# Configure exception reason properties

When real-time enforcement, `enforce_real_time_validation` is set to `true`, Recommend level findings require an approved exception reason before the form can be saved.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_se.scan\_engine\_admin, sn\_se.scan\_engine\_read\_user, sn\_se.internal\_rest\_integration

## Procedure

1.  Select whether to **Enforce rejected exception reason validations**.

    When enabled, and if an exception reason is rejected, the object linked to that reason becomes read-only. Users cannot make additional changes until either:

    -   The Recommend level message is resolved.
    -   A new exception reason is submitted.
    This ensures strict compliance with validation rules and prevents inconsistent or unauthorized updates while an exception is unresolved.

2.  Select whether to **Enable approvals in production**.

    If `enable_exception_reason_approvals_in_production` is set to `false`, exceptions can only be approved in the instances in which they are raised.

    **Note:** This setting is only applicable to development instances.

3.  Approval groups will approve or reject exception requests and receive notifications.

    -   Use the`Enable approvals in production` setting to control whether exceptions can be approved in production instances or only in development environments.
    -   Approval group\(s\) displays the group or groups that will approve or reject exception reasons and also receive notifications when new approvals are requested.
4.  Select whether to **Exclude approved exception reasons from technical debt**.

    When enabled, findings with approved exception reasons will be excluded from technical debt metrics.

    **Note:** This does not remove the finding from the system.

5.  **Upon new finding found**, `er_finding_number_validation` , determines how exception reasons are handled when the same issue is detected again in a subsequent scan.

    Options are: **Auto Accept Existing Reason** and **Re-approve Existing Reason**.

6.  **Upon line number change**, `exception_reason_validation`

    -   ``Determines how approved exception reasons are handled when the finding's line number changes in the code.
    -   Options are **Auto Accept Existing Reason** \(default\) and **Re-approve Existing Reason**.
    Choose whether to automatically accept the existing reason.
