# Scan Engine definitions: Manageability

Scan Engine Manageability definitions measure the extent to which ServiceNow instances, applications, or infrastructure can be effectively monitored, configured, and maintained.

## Australia definitions

The following manageability definitions have been added for the Australia 2026 release:

Multiple tables are using the same number prefix

</td><td>

Multiple tables sharing the same number prefix can result in confusion and wasted effort and time due to workflow, integration, or script malfunctions leading to incorrect record processing or data inconsistencies as well as in inaccurate searches and reports.

</td><td>

This prefix is being shared by multiple tables. Tables should either have their own prefix or share their extended table's prefix.

The sys\_update\_xml table exceeds the recommended threshold

Performance issues may arise during upgrades.

</td><td>

Group the **sys\_update\_xml** table by the "Type" column, and take note of the largest groups. Often, there will be just one or two update types constituting the majority of the records. Once you have identified the type\(s\) of updates contributing the most, determine if those updates could be a result of some customization. If that's the case, recreate the table without extending **sys\_metadata**, or figure out a way to avoid creating/deleting records on it so frequently. There could also be a custom script responsible for the excess updates. Disable the customization and carefully clean up the excess records that were generated. If you are unable to identify the cause, contact &lt;ph conref="../reusables/conrefs.dita\#conrefs/company-no-reg-tm"/&gt; support for assistance.

Do not use gs.nowDateTime\(\) to set a GlideDateTime object. The nowDateTime\(\) method returns the date time in local format and the local time zone. The GlideDateTime object uses the date time in the internal format and UTC time zone.

</td><td>

Replace var gdt = new **GlideDateTime**\(**gs.nowDateTime**\(\)\); with var gdt = new **GlideDateTime\(\)**;.
