# Remediate Scan Engine findings with Now Assist

The Remediate Scan Engine findings with Now Assist feature accelerates technical debt resolution by providing AI-generated code fixes for leading practice violations. Developers can track and resolve issues in their code throughout the end-to-end workflow by reviewing and applying AI-recommended fixes.

For findings already identified by the scan engine, developers can generate AI-recommended fixes in bulk, review proposed changes, and apply fixes.

Goals:

-   Accelerate technical debt reduction across your instance with reduced time spent manually researching and writing code fixes.
-   Maintain code quality by aligning fixes with ServiceNow leading practices.
-   Keep developers in control with an AI code review before implementing suggestions.

## Remediation workflow

Once the Scan Engine returns findings, the Developers can view findings that are assigned to them and evaluate the AI generated suggestions.
