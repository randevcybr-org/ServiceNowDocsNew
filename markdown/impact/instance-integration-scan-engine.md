# Scan Engine integrations

You can integrate the Scan Engine into a variety of processes, such as the syncing of definitions or exception reasons, as well as integrating with your existing agile project management systems.

Scan Engine has the ability to integrate with your other environments running Impact so that you can:

-   Compare technical debt across instances
-   Sync custom definitions across instances
-   Enable approvals for finding exceptions in production
-   Create user stories from findings

The following integrations are available for the Scan Engine.

When a developer submits a deployment request, the system automatically runs compliance checks to ensure all required rules are met—blocking deployment if conditions fail.

</table>**Note:** Except for Jira, Azure DevOps and AES/AEMC integration types, you must first register your instances as part of **My SN Instances**. You will then need to configure either your basic or OAuth authentication methods for your instances to enable synchronization.
