# Generate a certificate

Generate a certificate to use with the Discovery Console for OT or upload your own certificates. This certificate allows the Console to boot up.

## Before you begin

**Note:** If you choose to do so, you can create your own certificate if it is required by your company's policies.

## About this task

However, following this initial boot, it is recommended that you use the Console to generate a new CA. This task describes how to generate a new Console certificate for the Discovery Console for OT.
