## Sensor Credentials

In the Sensor Credentials section, you can generate or submit a password for sensor credentials and then select **Generate Bundle**.

**Note:** The Sensor certificate automatically renews when the Console certificate is renewed.

## Collector Credentials

In the Collector Credentials section, you can generate Collector credentials, generate a password bundle, and submit a bundle with either a ZIP file or a tar.gz \(tgz\) formatted file. Select the zip format for Window collectors and the tar.gz format for Linux collectors.
