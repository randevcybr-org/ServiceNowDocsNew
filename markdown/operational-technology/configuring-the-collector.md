# Configure the OT Discovery Collector

The OT Discovery Collector is an application that you can install on a Windows or Linux system.

## Collector Credentials

Depending on how you have deployed the Console, you may need to manually edit the hostname value in the `config.json` file to validate the Collector's credentials. If you install an offline Console or install into cloud environments, the `hostname` value may not be correct. For the Collector, the hostname needs to be set to the Console hosts external/network IP address. It is important to check this setting and adjust it as needed.
