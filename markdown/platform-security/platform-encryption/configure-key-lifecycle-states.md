# Configure key lifecycle states

After you have created a cryptographic specification, you can configure the lifecycle actions for the keys in your instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_kmf.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Key Management** &gt; **Cryptographic Modules** &gt; **All**.

2.  Select the cryptographic module to configure the lifecycle of a key.

3.  Select a key alias on the Crypto Specifications tab.

    ![Shows how to select a key from the lifecycle definition.](../image/key-lifecycle-configuration.jpg)

4.  Select **Next**.

    The Field Lifecycle Template loads. Default Key Lifecycle values are created based on the selected algorithms for the defined cryptographic specification.

5.  Select a Key Lifecycle from the **Applies to** column on the Lifecycle Definition step for the crypto specification.
