# Validate file mime type in AttachmentCreator soap web service \[New in Security Center 1.3 and updated in 1.5\]

The **glide.attachment.enforce\_security\_validation** property determines whether Multipurpose internet Mail Extensions \(MIME\) files undergo validation.

Ensure that MIME-types are validated for attachments to prevent dangerous files from being uploaded on your instance using wrong file extensions.

Set the **glide.attachment.enforce\_security\_validation** system property to **true**. When set to **true**, files are uploaded with the correct file type extension.
