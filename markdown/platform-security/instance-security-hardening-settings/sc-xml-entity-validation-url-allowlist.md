# Restrict XML external entities

Configure system properties to ensure that your instance only processes XML from trusted sources to help prevent XML external entity \(XXE\) attacks.

Use the **glide.xml.entity.whitelist** and **glide.xml.entity.whitelist** system properties to prevent your instance from processing XML from untrusted sources.

XML external entity \(XXE\) attacks occur when a malicious actor modifies incoming XML \(such as adding HTTP requests\) to access data or intact with otherwise restricted systems. To help prevent these attacks, the **glide.xml.entity.whitelist.enabled** system property limits the sources from which your instance executes XML. Use the **glide.xml.entity.whitelist** property to define a set of trusted sources.

Ensure that the **glide.xml.entity.whitelist** system property exists in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table, and is set to `http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/`. Ensure that the **glide.xml.entity.whitelist.enabled** system property exists in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table and is set to the value `true`.

**Tip:**

Values other than `http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/` can be included in the **glide.xml.entity.whitelist** property, but are unnecessary for the out of the box platform state. Review any additional values to determine if they are safe.

## More information

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.
