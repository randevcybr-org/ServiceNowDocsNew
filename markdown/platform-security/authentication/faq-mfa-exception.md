# MFA enforcement exception

FAQ related to MFA enforcement exception and why it’s important.

1.  How can the MFA mandate be relaxed for specific users?

    In the Yokohama release, a new user group, MFA Exempted User Group record is added. Based on the default condition, there’s an MFA policy added, any user who is a member of this group is enforced with MFA.

    To relax MFA for specific users, follow the procedure:

    -   Navigate to **MFA context**. The Step-Up MFA Policy associated with the MFA context record should be “Enforce MFA for non-SSO logins.![Policy](../images/mfa-excempted-policy.png)
    -   Under the **Policy Input** related list, select the **Is a member of MFA exempted group** filter criteria record.
    -   Select **MFA Exempted User Group**.![Policy Input](../images/mfa-exempted-input.png)
    -   Add users to this group as a member to exempt them from MFA enforcement.![Add users](../images/mfa-exempted-add-user.png)
    **Note:** If you have a different policy associated with the MFA context, you can add “Is a member of MFA exempted group” filter criteria to your policy and modify the policy conditions to exempt users of this group from MFA enforcement.

2.  How can the MFAs mandate be relaxed for certain roles?

    In the Yokohama release, an empty new role **Has MFA exempted role** filter criterion is added. There are conditions added to the MFA policy to exempt users who have the roles part of exempted role criteria from the MFA enforcement.

    On the MFA validation page, there's a check box to remember a browser. MFA isn’t enforced on the remembered browser:

    ![MFA do not challenge](../images/mfa-enforcement-delay.png)

    -   The duration specified by this system property. `glide.authenticate.multifactor.browser.fingerprint.validity`. The default value of the property is 8 hours. This duration can be increased by up to 24 hours. Similarly using the `glide.authenticate.multifactor.remember.browser.default` system property the default value of the check box can be set to true.
    -   Navigate to **Multi-factor Authentication** &gt; **Properties** and adjust these four properties to control the remembered browser feature.![Property changes](../images/mfa-enforcement-property-change.png)
7.  How does MFA work for accounts shared by users?

    Single accounts shared by multiple users are a security risk. It isn’t recommended to share an account with multiple users.
