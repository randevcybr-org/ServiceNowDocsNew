# Authentication

ServiceNow's authentication validates the identity of a user who accesses an instance, and then authorizes the user to features that match the user's role or job function.

## Get started

</table>You can use several different methods to authenticate users. User credentials are matched to different saved credentials for each method.

**Note:**

-   The Okta SSO plugin is deprecated.
-   To learn more about the security properties that affect authorization processing, see [Access control](../../../administer/security-center/reference/sc-access-control.md) in Instance Security Hardening Settings.
-   You can use SAML and Digest Authentication through the Multiple Provider SSO application.
