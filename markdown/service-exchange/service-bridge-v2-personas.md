# User roles for providers

Learn about the roles, skills, and tasks for the different users in the Service Exchange for Providers application.

A user role is a pre-configured role in the application that is made up of multiple granular roles. The user roles are designed to correspond to the common job titles for managers, analysts, and service owners in an IT organization. If you want your users and groups to have more access than a role permits, you can add more granular roles to your users and groups. If you want to limit the access for specific users and groups at the task level, you can remove the granular roles. You can also build custom roles and access controls \(ACLs\) to suit your needs.
