2.  Select **Definitions** from the secondary navigation.

3.  Select the **Cleanup scripts** tab.

4.  Select **New**.

5.  Enter a name for your script.

6.  Select the order number for your script.

7.  Check **Active** when your script is ready.

8.  Enter your script in the **Script** field, and select **Save**.


## Disable emails

To create a cleanup script to disable emails, do the following.

-   Select **New** on the cleanup scripts tab.
-   Add the name `Disable emails`.
-   Check **Active**.
-   In the script field, add

    ```
    gs.setProperty("glide.email.read.active", false);gs.setProperty("glide.email.smtp.active", false);
    ```

    .
