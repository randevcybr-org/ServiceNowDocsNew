# Configure the spoke selector for external systems

Configure the spoke selector for Aria to enable the configuration and execution of billing requests.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The spoke selector application provides a common framework that enables the configuration and execution of integration requests. It operates by selecting the matching implementations based on the configured input parameters for each request.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Spoke selector** &gt; **Request type**.

2.  Select **Billing request**.

    The billing request is configured with a request definition that invokes Aria APIs. This demo implementation serves as a reference for configuring a new request definition that retrieves billing-related data from a third-party system for billing requests.

3.  Create the Integration request definitions.

    By giving an appropriate value for **Order** or by defining the **Selection condition** the new request definition that fetches the billing-related data is triggered.

4.  To create Integration request definitions, navigate to **All** &gt; **Spoke selector** &gt; **Request definition**.

5.  In the Integration request definitions screen, select **New** in the header section.
