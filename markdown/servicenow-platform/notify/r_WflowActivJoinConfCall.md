# Join conference call workflow activity

The **Join Conference Call** activity connects an incoming or outgoing call to a Notify conference call.

Notify includes the workflows Notify: \(Re\)join Conference Call and Notify: Join Conference Call Via SMS to demonstrate how to use the **join conference call** activity to connect inbound and outbound calls, and inbound SMS messages to a conference call.

## Input variables

Input variables determine the initial behavior of the activity.

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Record|Select this check box to record the conference call.|
|Advanced|Select this check box to display advanced configuration options.|
|Script|Specify advanced configuration options using JavaScript, such as if the new participant should be muted upon joining the conference call. You can access values from the workflow scratchpad.|

## Conditions

The conditions determine which transition comes after this activity. The **join conference call** activity does not specify any conditions by default.

You can add an error condition to this activity. The activity transitions through the error condition if the confernece\_call scratchpad variable is not set.

## Scratchpad entries

The activity uses the workflow scratchpad to read persistent values.

A GlideRecord for a single conference call record. A call processed by this activity is added to this conference call. If this value is not specified, the **join conference call** activity will log an error.When initiating an outgoing call workflow using the Notify API call\(String notifyPhoneNumber, String toPhoneNumber, GlideRecord conferenceCall\) method, this scratchpad value is set automatically to the conference call GlideRecord. For incoming call workflows, or workflows initiated using a different mechanism, you must explicitly set this scratchpad value.
