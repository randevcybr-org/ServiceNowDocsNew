# Real time transcriptions for ServiceNow Voice for Customer Service Management

Agents can see a transcript of voice calls while interacting with customers. Real time transcription allows agents to better understand customer issues, and allows managers to gain insights into customer trends and agent training gaps.

## Inbound call example flow for customers and agents

The below examples illustrate common scenarios for using real-time transcriptions for inbound calls. The customer calls in and requests to speak to an agent. As soon as the call begins, the agent can see the transcript of the call in chat panel as they work with the customer. The real time transcript is not visible to the customer, however, the transcript can help the agent better understand the customer issue and refer back to the conversation for clarification.

Personas:

-   Customer Service Agent
-   Customer

Example Customer Flow for inbound calls.

1.  Customer dials an Amazon Connect customer service number.
2.  Confirm the approval for recording \(press 1\#\).
3.  Give instruction: “Speak to a live agent”.
4.  Provide a subject for the customer service agent: “Router Issue”.
5.  Confirm the subject and wait for the agent to pick up the call.

Example Agent Flow for inbound calls.

1.  Log in to your ServiceNow instance and open the Configurable Workspace
2.  Log in to Amazon Connect.
3.  Set status to **Online**.
4.  Wait for a call alert and answer the call.
5.  A new interaction with the subject and chat panel opens with the real time transcript.

## Outbound call example flow for agents

The below example illustrates a common scenario for using real-time transcriptions in outbound calls. The agent contacts the customer, and as soon as the call starts, the agent can see the transcript of the call in chat panel as they work with the customer. The real time transcript is not visible to the customer, however, the transcript can help the agent better understand the customer issue and refer back to the conversation for clarification.

Persona: Customer Service Agent.

1.  Log in and open the Configurable Workspace.
