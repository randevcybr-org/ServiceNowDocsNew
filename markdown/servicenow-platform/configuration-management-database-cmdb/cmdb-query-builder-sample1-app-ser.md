Use this example to build a CMDB query to find all critical application services, and their owner.

## Before you begin

Role required: none

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **CMDB Query Builder** and then select **Create new**.

2.  Enter `All critical application services` as the query **Name**.

3.  Choose **CMDB Query** and then select **Create**.

4.  In the **CMDB Classes** list, locate the **Application Service** class and then drag it to the canvas.

    **Tip:** Use the search box to find items quickly.

5.  Add a filter to the application service node.

    1.  Point to the application service node and then select the **Apply filters** icon.

    2.  In the Filters section, add the condition **\[business criticality\] \[is\] \[1 - most critical\]**.

    3.  Close the Filters section.

6.  Add columns to the query results.

    1.  In the Properties sidebar, select **Add Columns**.

    2.  Select **business criticality** and **owned by**, and then select outside the columns list to close it.
