# Exploring CMDB success advisor

Learn about CMDB success advisor and review the benefits it can provide for different users in your organization.

## CMDB success advisor overview

With the CMDB success advisor application, you can review CMDB Data Manager policies and Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) settings to identify areas where improvements can be made in Data Foundations and the Hardware Asset Management \(HAM\) application. The advisor uses customized CMDB metrics to improve data quality for targeted configuration item \(CI\) classes, identifying and monitoring the CI classes most critical to your organizational processes to enable complete and accurate data in Data Foundations, and tracking hardware model categories for HAM.

Users with the sn\_cmdb\_admin role can configure and improve CMDB data accuracy based on specific business use cases. With targeted CI tracking, practical data integration suggestions, and application-specific dashboards, the CMDB success advisor enables CMDB administrators to improve CMDB data accuracy and achieve key business outcomes.

For Data Foundations, administrators can select and manage principal classes, monitor data quality across the CI classes most critical to incidents, changes, and problems, and use integration coverage analysis to ensure the right data sources are keeping the CMDB accurate and complete.

For Hardware Asset Management, administrators can focus on critical hardware model categories to improve normalization rates, asset life cycle tracking, and data accuracy for business outcomes like HAM.

Focused CMDB setup for specific business outcomesFor Data Foundations, advisor dashboard scope is built from principal classes recommended based on incident, problem, and change \(IPC\) activity. If IPC data is unavailable, classes are ranked by how widely they are used across your CMDB. For new instances with no historical data, a set of default classes is suggested.

For HAM, advisor dashboard scope is defined by hardware model categories.
