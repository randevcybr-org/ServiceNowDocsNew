# Create a compliance audit

Create a compliance audit. Compliance offers two types of audits: one uses templates to define conditions and the other uses a script.

## Before you begin

Role required: certification\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Ensure that an appropriate template record was created for this audit.

    **Note:** Conditions in the template define the values to audit.

2.  Use the CI Class Manager:

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **CI Class Manager**.

    2.  Select a class from the **Class Hierarchy**.

    3.  In the sidebar, check **Advanced** and then select **Audit** in the **Compliance** group.

3.  Or, navigate to one of these modules:

    -   **All** &gt; **Compliance** &gt; **Audits**
    -   **All** &gt; **Compliance** &gt; **Architecture Compliance** &gt; **Audits**
    -   **All** &gt; **Compliance** &gt; **Desired State** &gt; **Audits**
    -   **All** &gt; **Compliance** &gt; **Scripted Audits** &gt; **Audits**
4.  Select **New**.

    The system opens a new record for the audit type associated with the navigation path you selected. The **Audit type** field is read-only.

5.  Complete the form using the fields described in the table below.

6.  Right-click the header bar and select **Save**.

    The Audit Results and the Follow On Tasks related lists appear on the form.

7.  To run the audit immediately, select **Run Audit**.

    When template audits run, ServiceNow updates the date and time in the **Last run date** field and populates the related lists. For scripted audits, the **Last run date** field is not populated.

8.  View the records that passed and the discrepancies found by the audit in the **Audit Results** related list.

    You can open template records and any follow-on tasks directly from this related list. Notice that the value in the **Task description** field appears as the **Short description** in the follow-on tasks.

    **Note:** You cannot delete audit records that have audit results or audit results that have follow-on tasks. ServiceNow disables the **Delete** option in records and lists where these dependent records exist.

<table id="table_r1l_nm3_dp"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name for this audit.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Filter

</td><td>

Filter to use when the audit type is Scripted. This field is required for scripted audits, but is hidden for all other audit types.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Template

</td><td>

\[Required\] Template to use when this audit runs. Audit type filters the list of available templates, and only the active versions of templates are available for selection. For example, when you create an audit from Desired State, only templates of the Desired State audit type are available for selection. For the Desired State and Architecture Compliance audit types, only templates for tables that extend the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] table are available. This field is hidden when the audit type is **Scripted**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Table

</td><td>

\[Read-only\] Table for the template.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Create tasks

</td><td>

Option to create follow-on tasks for correcting discrepancies \(selected\). In a scripted audit, you can create the logic for either task state by using **true** to create tasks or **false** to not create tasks. By default, this check box is cleared \(**false**\) in a new audit record.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assignment type

</td><td>

Method for assigning follow-on tasks. This field is visible only when the **Create task** check box is selected. Choices are:-   User Field: Select a user reference field on the table being audited. For example, you choose the user identified in the **Managed by** field on the failed record to perform the tasks. This selection displays the **Assigned to** and **Assign to empty** fields. If the reference field on the record is empty, the value in the **Assign to empty** field is used.
-   Specific User: Select a specific user to perform the tasks. This selection displays the **User** field.
-   Group Field: Select a group reference field on the table being audited. For example, you choose the group identified in the **Support group** field on the failed record to perform the tasks. Tasks are assigned to all members of the group. This selection displays the **Assign to group** and **Assign to empty** fields. If the reference field on the record is empty, the value in the **Assign to empty** field is used.
-   Specific Group: Select a specific group to perform the tasks. This selection displays the **Group** field. All members of the selected group are assigned to the tasks.


</td></tr><tr><td>

User

</td><td>

Specific user this audit assigns to follow-on tasks. This user must have the certification role. This field is available under these conditions:-   Assignment type is set to **Specific User**.
-   Assign to empty is set to **Create Assigned Task**, and **Assignment type** is set to **User Field**.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Assign to group

</td><td>

Group field that defines which group this audit assigns to the follow-on task. This field is available only when the **Assignment type** is **Group Field**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Group

</td><td>

Specific group this audit assigns to follow-on tasks. This field is available only when the **Assignment type** is **Specific Group**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assign to

</td><td>

User field that defines which user this audit assigns to the follow-on task. This field is available only when the **Assignment type** is **User Field**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Assign to empty

</td><td>

Behavior to use if the field selected in **Assign to** or **Assign to group** is blank on the record being audited. For example, if a follow-on task must be assigned to a manager, but no manager is identified, the **Assign to empty** setting determines what happens. This field appears only when the **Assignment type** is **User Field** or **Group Field**. Choices are:-   Do Not Create Task: No follow-on task is created when the **Assign to** or **Assign to group** field is empty.
-   Create Unassigned Task: Create a follow-on task, but do not assign it to any user or group. The task can be manually assigned later.
-   Create Assigned Task: Create a follow-on task and assign it to the user or group specified. If the assignment type is **User Field**, the **User** field becomes available. If the assignment type is **Group Field**, the **Group** field becomes available.
The audit automatically creates follow-on tasks for all records that have **Assign to** populated, regardless of the **Assign to empty** setting.
