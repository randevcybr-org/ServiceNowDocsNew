# Settings checklist for Data Foundations in CMDB success advisor

Use this checklist to review Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) and Data Foundations settings in CMDB success advisor that directly affect Data Foundations data quality, configuration item \(CI\) to asset synchronization, and life cycle alignment.

## CMDB and Data Foundations settings checklist

Confirm that each setting is configured to support accurate and complete CI data for your principal classes in the CMDB.

|Select|Check item \(field\)|Description|Action|

-   Reconciliation rules are configured to protect high-quality CI attribute data from being overwritten by lower-quality sources.
-   Data Manager policies are configured for all principal classes.
