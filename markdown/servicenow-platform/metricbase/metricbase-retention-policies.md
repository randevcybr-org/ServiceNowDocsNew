# MetricBase retention policies

Retain data in MetricBase according to retention policies.

Retention policies include multiple retention schedules with coarser granularity the longer that the data is kept. For example, the Coarse retention policy stores sampled data every:

-   Hour for one week \(7 Days per 1-hour period\)
-   Two hours for one month \(31 days per 2-hour period\)
-   Day for 13 months \(397 Days per 1-day period\)

In this policy, the specified metric is measured every hour for the first 7 days. It is then measured every other hour for the next 31 days, and once a day for the next 397 days. MetricBase deletes data that is older than 435 days.

To see the list of all supported retention policies, navigate to **MetricBase** &gt; **Retention Policies**.
