# Configuring a phone PIN

You can set up or reset a phone PIN that can be used for caller authentication during a call with an agent.

If the **Require authentication** field is set to **true** for an operation handler, the corresponding operation is invoked only after the caller enters the PIN.

**Important:** It is applicable for both ServiceNow Voice for ITSM and ServiceNow Voice for CSM applications.
