# Instance Data Replication XML stats

Extract Instance Data Replication \(IDR\)-related data from your instance to monitor replication status.

## IDR XML Stats

You can view key metrics from your IDR producer and consumer instances to monitor performance and the status of IDR processing.

In a browser where the instance is running, append the following text to the instance URL: `xmlstats.do?include=idr`. The following output is an example of the IDR XML stats.

|Metric|Description|
|------|-----------|
|**idr status**|Shows whether IDR is enabled for your instance.|
|Producer instance| |
|**producer producer\_last\_run**|The last time that the **IDRProducerJob** scheduled job ran \(GMT\).|
|**producer replication\_queue\_position**|Position of the cursor in the replication queue.|
|replication\_queue\_reading\_lag|The time between when a change is made, and when the **IDRProducerJob** scheduled job sends that change to the network.|
|replset last\_message\_sent\_on|The last time data was sent to the network from this replication set.|
|replset last\_position|The cursor position in the data\_replication\_queue when the last message was sent for this replication set.|
|last\_sent\_message\_id|The message ID of the last sent message from the data\_replication\_queue.|
|name|The name of the replication set.|
|status|The replication set status.|
|topic\_name|The topic name in the message queue for this replication set.|
|Consumer instance| |
|consumer\_last\_run|The last time the **IDRConsumerJob** scheduled job \(local\) or **IDRDeltaConsumerJob-&lt;instanceid&gt;** scheduled job \(remote\) ran \(GMT\).|
|replset data\_lag|Time since the last heartbeat was received. Heartbeats should occur every minute for a replication set.|
|last\_heartbeat\_received\_on|Time of the last heartbeat for this replication set.|
|last\_message\_received\_network\_time|For the last received message, the time difference between when it was sent to the message queue and when it was picked up by the consumer instance.|
|replset last\_position|The cursor position in the data\_replication\_queue, at which the last message was sent for this replication set.|
|name|The name of the replication set.|
|status|The replication set status.|
|topic\_name|The topic name in the message queue for this replication set.|
