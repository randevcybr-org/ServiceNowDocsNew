# Knowledge article version numbers

Knowledge article version numbers follow a specific pattern. Increments to the version number depend on the revision type.

Article version numbers follow this pattern: &lt;major release number.minor release number&gt;.

The type of revision being made to an article determines the increment. A minor revision increments the version number by 0.01. A major revision, such as publishing an article, increments the version to the next whole number, for example, from version 2.02 to 3.0.

The following example illustrates the life cycle of a versioned article and the changes to the version number.
