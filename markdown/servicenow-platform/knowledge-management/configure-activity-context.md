# Configure activity contexts for Self-Service Analytics

Define the type of activities you want to collect as Self-Service Analytics data for a user entity such as consumers and customer contacts.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ssa\_core.self\_service\_manager

## About this task

The activity types you add to an activity context are already predefined for use in applications that use the Subscriptions and Activity Feed Framework. This framework is available when you install the Subscriptions and Activity Feed Framework plugin \(com.snc.activity\_subscriptions\). The plugin is activated when you activate the Self-Service Analytics Core plugin \(com.snc.self\_service\_analytics\_core\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service Analytics** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Activity Context**.

2.  In the Activity Contexts list, search for and select the activity context for your user entity.

    -   For consumers, select **Consumer**.
    -   For customer contacts, select **Contact**.
    -   For user entities other than consumers and customer contacts, click **New** to create another activity context.
    **Note:** To get the activity contexts Consumer and Contact by default, you must install Self-Service Analytics for Customer Service \(com.snc.pa.self\_service\_analytics\_csm\) plugin.

3.  On the Activity Context form, verify the default field values for consumers and customer contacts, or fill in the values for a custom configuration.
