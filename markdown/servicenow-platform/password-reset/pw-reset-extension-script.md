# Password Reset extension script categories

You can use a custom extension script to extend Password Reset functionality for credential store, verification, or identification types.

**Note:** To use a script include as an extension script, you must set it to **Active** status.

## Password Reset extension script categories

Extension scripts must specify a category that indicates which script include is being extended, for example, `category: 'password_reset.extension.enrollment_check'`. The ServiceNow platform installs several scripts in each category. A script in the **Enrollment check** category can perform the enrollment check for a verification. Detailed information on each extension script appears in [Password Reset extension scripts](pw-reset-ext-script-includes.md).

|Extension script category|Description|
