# Learn how Skill Determination works

Use Skill Determination to add skills to incoming work items so that agents with those skills can work on it.

Skill Determination uses two rules:

-   Skill Determination rule—set what skills you want to add to incoming work items.
-   Business rule for Skill determination—set criteria for when a business rule must execute.

    When executed, it runs on the source table defined in the Skill Determination rule, triggers the corresponding Skill Determination rule, and adds the skills that are in the Skill Determination rule record to the incoming work item.


The flow chart shows a visual representation of the Skill Determination flow.
