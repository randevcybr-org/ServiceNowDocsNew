# Configure HTTP response headers

Configure standard name-value pairs for HTTP response headers. You designate if the configuration applies to all pages, or to specific types \(Service Portal, UI Page, or UX application record\).

## Before you begin

Role required: An elevated access security\_admin role is required to configure an **All Pages** type header. An admin role is required to configure a **Specific Type** header.

## Procedure

1.  In the Navigator pane, type `sys_response_header.list`.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Fill in the fields on the form.

<table id="table_osc_lwk_snb"><thead><tr><th>

</td><td>

Check box that designates that this HTTP response header configuration is active.

Application

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td>

Applies to

</td><td>

Type of record the HTTP response header configuration applies to.-   **Specific Type**

HTTP response header configuration is for the specific type and record you select in the **Type** and **Record** fields.

-   **All Pages**

HTTP response header configuration is for all pages and record types.

**Note:** Only users with an elevated access privilege security\_admin role can configure HTTP response headers for the All Pages type header.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

Type of record the HTTP response header configuration applies to. -   **Service Portal \[sp\_portal\]**

Records related to the Service Portal.

-   **UI Page \[sys\_ui\_page\]**

Standard UI pages in the ServiceNow AI Platform.

-   **UX Application \[sys\_ux\_page\_registry\]**

Standard UX applications in the ServiceNow AI Platform.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Record

</td><td>

Specific record the HTTP response header configuration applies to. To select a record:1.  Click the Search \(![Search icon](../../../common/image/List_SearchIcon.png)\) icon to access the Select the document form.
2.  In the **Table name** field, the default is the type you selected in the **Type** field. Do not change it.
3.  In the **Document** field, select the record from the table.

For example, if you selected **Service Portal \[sp\_portal\]**, you select a specific Service Portal-related record in that table.

4.  Click **OK**.
 You can only access this field if you selected **Specific Type** in the **Applies to** field.

## HTTP header configuration for advanced users

The HTTP response header table \(sys\_response\_header\) in the List view contains two additional columns - **Add by** and **Order**.

<table id="table_wqj_wlf_14b"><thead><tr><th>

Column

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

Adds a default integer order value to a header configuration regardless of the type of header \(**All Pages** or a **Specific page**\). -   When a specific page request takes place, both of the header types are interleaved based on the **Order**.
-   The net headers, regardless of the type, are sorted first, based on the **Order** and added to the response based on the ordered header list.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Add By

</td><td>

Contains the following values:-   **Append**

\(Default value\) This option is relevant when multiple headers with the same name are configured. In this case, they are both added to the HTTP response header.

-   **Overwrite**

This option is relevant when the same header \(a header with the same name\) is attempting to add twice in the ordered header list \(see **Order** description\). The header with the higher order and with an **Overwrite** selection in **Add By** overwrites the same header trying to be set with a lower order.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>You may have situations where a couple of similar **All Pages** type header configurations could overwrite a **Specific Type** type header configuration. An example of a **Specific Type** configuration would be one for a specific UI page. You can remedy this situation by adjusting the **Add by** and **Order** columns, as in the following examples.

### Append example

The ServiceNow AI Platform is trying to set headers in the following order, and **Append** is the default value for each in the **Add By** column. ![Append example - sys_response_header.list](../image/headers-all-append-list-view.jpg)

In this example, the second \(Header 2\) and third \(Header 3\) response header configurations have the same name \(Content-Security-Policy\). In this case, Header 3 is appended to Header 2. If a request is made for a specific page you configured with a Header 3 response, the net HTTP response headers are both Header 2 and Header 3.

![Append example - resulting HTTP response header](../image/headers-all-append-page-response.png)

### Overwrite

The ServiceNow AI Platform is trying to set headers in the following order, and you've selected **Overwrite** in the **Add By** column for the third header. ![Overwrite example - sys_response_header.list](../image/headers-one-overwrite-list-view.jpg)

In this example, the second \(Header 2\) and third \(Header 3\) response header configurations have the same name \(Content-Security-Policy\). In this case, Header 3 overwrites Header 2. If a request is made for a specific page you configured with a Header 3 response, the net HTTP response header is only Header 3.
