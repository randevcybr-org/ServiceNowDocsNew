# Policy logic condition fields

Policy logic is a set of conditions that is used for determining whether a policy is compliant or non-compliant. You can use the condition builder to specify conditions for the policy.

## Policy logic page

Select the **or** and **and** button to add multiple rules in the condition set. Select the minus icon ![Minus icon.](../../devops-config/image/pace-output-type-delete.png) to delete a condition.

You can add a condition set by selecting the **New condition set** button.

</table>The **else if** statement enables you to specify a new condition if the first condition is false. The **else** statement enables you to specify a new condition if it does not apply to the **if** statement.

You can add a dependent condition by selecting **or** or **and** next to the condition.

You can see a list of the data sources under the Data source tab.![Data source tab.](../image/pace-data-source-tab-3.jpg)

You can calculate fields using numeric operators and use these variables to calculate the desired value in a policy logic.

**Note:** This only supports numeric fields.

|Operator|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Plus \(+\)|Add variables and constants. For example, "Var1 + Var2..."|
|Minus \(-\)|Subtract variables and constants. For example, "Var1 - Var2..."|
|Multiplication \(\*\)|Multiple variables and constants. For example, "Var1 \* Var2..."|
|Division \(/\)|Divide variables and constants. For example, "Var1 / Var2..."|
|Parentheses \(\)|Use parentheses to support the order of operators.|
|calc\[\]|Use the brackets to evaluate an expression.|

You can mix and match between the operators. For example, "Var1 +Var2\*Var3 / Var4".
