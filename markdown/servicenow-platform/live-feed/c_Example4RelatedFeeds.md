# Related feeds table notification

This example demonstrates table notifications to be sent out to related feeds.

For this example, whenever the status of a story changes to **Complete**, a table notification message is sent to the related sprint, release, or epic. Messages are posted only if the related feed already exists; this notification does not create a new feed.

-   **Table**: Story \[rm\_story\]
-   **Active**: Select the check box.
-   **Update**: Select the check box.
-   **Post to Live Feed**: Select the check box.
-   **Record feeds**: Move **Sprint**, **Release**, and **Epic** to the **Selected** column.
-   **Conditions**: \[State\] \[changes to\] \[Complete\]
-   **Description**: `Story is done; message to Epic, Release, and Sprint`
-   **Message**:

    ```
    ${URI} status changed to ${state}
    ```
