# Problem resolved \(advanced\)

This advanced example demonstrates a table notification that generates an automatic message on Live Feed whenever a problem is closed.

It also adds a message about the assigned user and posts the message from the assignment group profile instead of the problem record.

-   **Table**: Problem \[problem\]
-   **Active**: Select the check box.
-   **Update**: Select the check box.
-   **Post to Live Feed**: Select the check box.
-   **Conditions**: \[Problem State\] \[is\] \[Closed/Resolved\]
-   **Description**: `Problem Resolved`
-   **Message**:

    ```
    Problem ${number} - ${short_description} has been resolved. ${fixedByMsg}
    ```

-   **Before script**:

    ```
    //cancel if we didn't just change the problem state if ( !changedFields. contains ( "problem_state" ) )
    answer  = false ;
     
     //if we have an assigned_to value add a comment about who it was //create a new variable fixedByMsg that we can access from the message
    fixedByMsg  = "" ; if ( !current. assigned_to. nil ( ) )
    fixedByMsg  = " Thank you " + current. assigned_to. getDisplayValue ( ) ;
     
     //make the message appear to come from the assignment group if we have one if ( !current. assignment_group. nil ( ) )
    profileSource  = current. assignment_group. getRefRecord ( ) ; //need GlideRecord object
    ```
