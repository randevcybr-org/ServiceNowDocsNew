# Masked

The masked variable inserts a field that masks the text entered.

Each character entered is displayed as an asterisk \(\*\). Use this variable to ask users for sensitive or confidential data such as passwords.

By selecting the **Use encryption** check box, you can configure the variable to encrypt its value using various encryption algorithms before storing in the database. These values can only be decrypted by using now\_GR.variables.var\_name.getDecryptedValue\(\) on RITM, Catalog Task, or any task extension record created using a record producer.

**Note:** By default, the **Use encryption** field is set to true to ensure secure storage of information.

On the variable editor, you can also decrypt and encrypt the values of a masked variable using the **Show** and **Hide** buttons. These buttons are not available for a fulfiller \(itil\) without the catalog\_view\_masked role. You can only view the value that you specified while requesting.
