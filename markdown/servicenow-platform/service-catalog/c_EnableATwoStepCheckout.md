# Service Catalog checkout models

The service catalog defaults to one-step checkout model, but also allows two-step checkout. Administrators and users with the catalog\_admin role can enable and configure the two-step checkout model and control how the delivery address is populated.

The service catalog defaults to a one-step checkout model. When a user clicks **Proceed to checkout** or **Order now**, items in the shopping cart are ordered and the order summary or status screen appears. The one-step checkout model runs in the following order:

**Press Checkout** &gt; **Order Summary**

The service catalog also supports a two-step checkout model. Under this model, when a user clicks **Proceed to checkout** or **Order now**, an order confirmation screen appears. You can edit the order, choose a delivery location, or upload an attachment before submitting the order. The two-step checkout model runs in the following order:

**Press Checkout Order** &gt; **Confirmation Screen** &gt; **Submit Order** &gt; **Order Summary**.

Access check for a catalog item is performed during its checkout. This check is also applicable in scripts and APIs.
