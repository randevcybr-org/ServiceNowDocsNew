**Note:**

-   The Reference Qualifier and glide\_list attribute applies to releases from Helsinki onward only. The attribute does not apply to Geneva.
-   You can set a value for this variable using the g\_form.setValue\(\) function in a catalog client script.
-   When the glide\_list attribute is not true, you can only set the value that is visible in the **Available** list using the g\_form.setValue\(\) function. This functionality is not applicable when the setValue\(\) function is called onLoad.
-   Table with large data causes performance issues when loading the page. Use reference qualifiers to reduce data or use the glide\_list attribute.
-   The values in the referenced table do not appear if the user is not logged in.
-   The list collector displays a maximum of 100 items in a list. After moving items to the **Selected** list, you can click **Run Filter** to refresh the **Available** list. This action will add more available items to the list, to a maximum of 100 items.
