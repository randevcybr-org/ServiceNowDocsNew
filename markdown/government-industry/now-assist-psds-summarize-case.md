# Summarize a government case using Now Assist for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\)

Generate a summary from the fields that you selected on the case record to help you quickly understand the case context by using the case summarization skill in the Now Assist for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\) application.

## About this task

Government service agents can utilize case summarization, powered by Now LLM, to gain contextual understanding of constituent issues throughout the case's lifecycle. The case summarization skill auto-generates informative summaries that distill key details from work notes, comments, and other case data, which can help agents resolve cases faster.

The case summarization component appears below the activity picker component on the playbook page templates, and is collapsed by default. When an agent generates a case summary by selecting **Summarize**, the component expands to display the summary information, including a description of the issue, the actions taken, and the next steps. For longer summaries, select **View more** and use the scroll bar to view the content.

The case summarization skill enables you to do the following actions:

-   Select Summarize to create a summary of the case details.
-   Select Share to work notes to copy the summary text to the activity stream.
    -   Review the summary text in the Share to work notes pop-up dialogue and modify the text as needed.
    -   Select Save to work notes on the pop-up dialogue to add the text to the activity stream.
-   Select the refresh icon in the component footer to refresh the text and get the latest summary.

After generating a summary, you can:

-   Review the summary information and edit as needed.
-   Provide feedback on the generated summary.
-   Add the summary information to the case work notes.
-   Copy the summary information to the clipboard.

**Note:** You can also generate a case summary on demand from the Now Assist panel. .

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Open a government service case by navigating to Lists in the CSM Configurable Workspace.

2.  In the Case summary by Now Assist component, select **Summarize**.

    **Note:** The Case summary by Now Assist component appears above the constituent card. Generating and displaying the summary may take several seconds. The component is collapsed by default and expands to display the summary. For longer summaries that don't fit in the window, select **View more** and use the scroll bar to view the rest of the content.
