# Configure guest user access

To enable SDK services to be accessible by unauthenticated users, you must configure the Mobile SDK on your ServiceNow instance to allow guest user access. A guest user can view public web pages hosted in an instance using NowWeb, have a conversation as a guest using NowChat, access public data on the instance using NowTableService and NowGraphQLService, and access custom API services configured for unauthenticated users using NowAPIService.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Mobile SDK** &gt; **All** and select the application to which you want to allow guest access.

2.  For each service that you want to enable guest access, add `"allowGuestAccess":true` to its configuration array.

    **Note:** The NowAttachment service does not currently support guest access.
