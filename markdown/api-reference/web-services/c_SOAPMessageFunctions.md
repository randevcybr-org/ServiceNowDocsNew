# SOAP message functions

After you create a SOAP message record, you can click **Generate sample SOAP messages** to populate the SOAP Message Functions related list.

The instance creates these functions by reading the supplied WSDL definition.

The **SOAP action**, **SOAP endpoint**, and **Envelope** fields should be populated automatically based on the WSDL definition. The **Envelope** defines the message to send to the endpoint. In this example, the **Envelope** values have this format:

```
...
<!-- optional --><short_description xsi:type="xsd:string">String</short_description>
...
```

To submit a specific value, enter the value directly in the appropriate XML tag. In this example, to set the Short description for a record, enter:

```
...
<short_description xsi:type="xsd:string">This is the short description</short_description>
...
```
