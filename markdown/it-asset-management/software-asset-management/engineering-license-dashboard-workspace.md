# Engineering License overview dashboard in workspace

Monitor and gain insights into your engineering applications license position and usage by viewing product usage reports in the Engineering license overview dashboard.

The Engineering license overview dashboard displays reports on normalized products and publishers that belong to engineering applications such as AutoCAD, GIS.

To narrow your results based on products or publishers across all tabs, use the filter in the left-hand corner of the dashboard. You can further narrow your results based on the date, user, or license server.

**Note:** Only products and publishers that belong to engineering applications and are listed in the Engineering Application License \[samp\_eng\_app\_license\] table appear in the filter. If no product or publisher is selected, the cumulative data for all products and publishers that belong to engineering applications appear.

All the reports are updated daily or whenever a new reconciliation result is available.

You can access the Engineering license overview dashboard by navigating to **Software asset** &gt; **Software Asset Workspace** &gt; **Software asset analytics** &gt; **Engineering license overview**.

Engineering Application Utilization and User Ratio \[samp\_eng\_utilization\_user\_ratio\]

</td><td>

Ratio of license utilization, for normalized products and publishers, to the number of users using those licenses.

-   Normalized publisher
-   Normalized product
-   License utilization: Percentage of peak consumption of the product against number of rights.
-   License to user ratio: Ratio of rights using this license to users using this product over the period of 90 days rights.

</td><td>

The total number or quantity of all available licenses; not just the active products but all the products.

-   The blue line represents the total number of licenses allocated to a product or a publisher
-   The green line indicates the concurrent usage of the licenses.
