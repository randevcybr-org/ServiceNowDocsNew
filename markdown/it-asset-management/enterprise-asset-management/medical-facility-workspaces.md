# Configurable workspaces for medical and facilities industries

Use configurable workspaces for creating and managing medical and facility assets and models.

## Overview of configurable workspaces for medical and facilities industries

Configurable workspaces are available for the following applications to work specifically on medical and facilities industries:

-   Enterprise Asset Management for Healthcare
-   Enterprise Asset Management for Facilities

Configurable workspaces give you a personalized experience as you get to work on assets and models pertaining to your industry. The following table mentions the applications, their corresponding workspaces, and benefits of using each workspace.

|Application|Configurable workspace|Benefits|
|-----------|----------------------|--------|
|Enterprise Asset Management for Healthcare|Medical Asset Workspace|Create and manage medical assets and models.|
|Enterprise Asset Management for Facilities|Facility Asset Workspace|Create and manage facilities assets and models.|

**Note:** The normalization process only runs in the Enterprise Asset Workspace and doesn't run for medical models and facility models within their specific workspaces.

If you’re logged in as a medical asset manager or a medical asset technician, by default you only get to see the medical asset category in the **Medical asset estate** view and the medical model category in the **Medical model management** view. Similarly if you’re logged in as a facility asset manager or a facility asset technician, you only get to see the facility asset category in the **Facility asset estate** view and the facility model category in the **Facility model management** view.

If you’re logged in to a specific workspace, you may see other assets and model categories that aren’t specific to your industry and have been added by the Enterprise admin or the system administrator role. As an example, if you’re logged in as a medical asset manager or a medical asset technician, you may see other assets and model categories such as construction, transportation, or facilities. However, you can't create or modify anything in these categories as these are read only.

You can evaluate how effectively your assets are functioning and being used through the reports based on asset key performance indicators in the **Asset performance** tab of the **Asset analytics** view. The asset performance report is also available on the contextual sidebar of the asset record, displayed by selecting the **Asset availability and related KPIs** icon \[![Asset KPI icon](../image/asset-kpi-icon.png)\].

You can receive assets from any workﬂow directly at the stockroom using the unified receiving functionality in the Medical Asset Workspace and Facility Asset Workspace. You can receive assets in any of the following ways:

-   Receive a single asset
-   Receive multiple assets in the shipments
-   Import assets in bulk and receive them

You can also manage supply and demand in your stockrooms effectively with inventory demand reports. To view the reports, follow these steps

1.  Navigate to the **Inventory** view.
2.  Select the **All stockrooms** tab.
3.  Select a stockroom for which you want to view the inventory reports.
4.  Select the **Inventory insights** tab.

## Workspace roles

The workspace that you can access depends on the role with which you log in to your ServiceNow instance. You can only view the workspace for which you have access.

</table>## Accessing the Admin center

Only the Enterprise admin role and the system administrator role can make configuration changes in the Admin center of the Medical Asset Workspace and the Facility Asset Workspace.

The Medical asset manager, Medical asset technician, Facility asset manager, or Facility asset technician can't make any changes in the Admin center except for the Task rate card and the Labor rate card options under the **TCO configuration** list.
