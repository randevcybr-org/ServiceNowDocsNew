# Updating CI class for unmatched cloud assets

Starting with Vulnerability Response v20.0, you can categorize the unmatched cloud assets from Qualys, Rapid7 and Tenable scanners into Unclassed Hardware by using the **sn\_sec\_cmn.unmatched\_cloud\_resource\_enabled** system property.

This system property with `false` as a default value is shipped with the base system. It classifies the unmatched cloud assets into a Unclassed hardware \(**cmdb\_ci\_unclassed\_hardware**\) or Cloud Resource \(**cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource**\) class for the integrations that bring in both infrastructure and cloud assets.

Starting with Vulnerability Response v20.0, the Asset Type column is added in the Third-party Integrations \(`sn_sec_int_integration`\) table to identify the integrations that support both infrastructure and cloud assets. The Asset Type column has the value, Hybrid for the scanners that bring in both infrastructure and cloud assets. For example, Qualys, Rapid7, and Tenable integrations have the value as Hybrid in the Asset Type column.

-   For new installation of Vulnerability Response v20.0 and above, all the unmatched cloud assets are categorized into:
    -   Unclassed Hardware class by default.
    -   Cloud Resources class, if you change the **sn\_sec\_cmn.unmatched\_cloud\_resource\_enabled** system property to `true`.
-   For upgrades to Vulnerability Response v20.0:
    -   If there are any assets in the Cloud Resource class, the sn\_sec\_cmn.unmatched\_cloud\_resource\_enabled system property is set to true so that the unmatched cloud assets continue to add to the Cloud Resource \(**cmdb\_ci\_cmp\_resource**\) class.
    -   Otherwise, the sn\_sec\_cmn.unmatched\_cloud\_resource\_enabled system property is set to false so that the unmatched cloud assets are categorized into Unclassed Hardware class.

**Note:** If you modify the value of the **sn\_sec\_cmn.unmatched\_cloud\_resource\_enabled** system property, ensure to delete unmatched configuration items on the previously targeted CI class, and reapply the lookup rules. To know more about how to delete the existing CIs and reapply CI lookup rules so that the new CIs are created in the right class, see [KB1533376](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1533376).
