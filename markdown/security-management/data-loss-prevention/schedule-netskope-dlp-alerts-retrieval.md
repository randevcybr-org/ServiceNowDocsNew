# Schedule the Netskope DLP incidents retrieval

Set a schedule to retrieve Netskope DLP incidents that match the criteria in the profile.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_dlir.admin

## About this task

You can plan how often you will poll for net new Netskope incidents that match the incident profile configuration. To enable automated incident ingestion, you must configure the scheduling and incident retrieval before you activate the profile. The profile can be configured to do one-time retrieval using the **One-Time Retrieval** check box. The historical date can be up to one month from the past.

## Procedure

1.  Configure the schedule to define how and when you pull incidents from Netskope.

2.  On the form, fill in the fields.
