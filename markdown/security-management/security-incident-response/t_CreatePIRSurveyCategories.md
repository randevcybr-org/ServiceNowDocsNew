# Create post incident review questionnaire categories

You can use the post incident review questionnaire categories that come with the base system or create your own categories.

## Before you begin

Role required: `sn_si.admin`

## About this task

To create a category of questions:

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Security Incident** &gt; **Post Incident Review - Assessments Setup**.

2.  In the **Assessment Questionnaire Configurations** section, select **Configure**.

    A list of questionnaire categories is displayed, along with their order and filters that define under what conditions the questions are asked \(for example, only when the security incident category is Criminal activity\). Each category is a section in the post incident review questionnaire and the questions in each category are included only when the security incident matches the Condition filter. For example, for a category of questions applying only to Linux servers, you can up a filter that selected security incidents where the affected resource type was Linux Server. In this category, you would then create all questions needed when a security incident is on a Linux Server. You use one of the categories supplied in the base system or create a category. This procedure assumes that you want to create a category before defining questions.

3.  Select **New** to create a new category.

4.  Fill in the fields on the form, as appropriate.
