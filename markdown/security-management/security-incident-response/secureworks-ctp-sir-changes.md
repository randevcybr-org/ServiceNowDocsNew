# Security Incident Response form changes after ticket ingestion

After a Secureworks CTP ticket has been ingested, a security incident is created and the corresponding updates are made to the security incident record.

## Worknotes

A worknote is posted with details of the ticket that triggered the security incident.

Click on the ticket link to navigate to the internal Secureworks Ticket to Task record. The **Click here** hyperlink takes you to the Secureworks CTP dashboard where you can view the ticket details.

If you had selected the **Log work note for new ticket** option in the Ticket Aggregation Criteria as described in the Create Profile: Mapping page, a worknote is posted when the ticket is aggregated.

Create security incident: Select a ticket from the list, click the **Actions** menu and click **Create security incident**. This option creates a new security incident for the ticket and this ticket is de-aggregated from the parent security incident.

Delete ticket record: Select a ticket from the list, click the **Actions** menu and click **Delete**. This option deletes the ticket record.

## Secureworks Ticket updates

This shows the standard ticket fields and tracks changes to the tickets during every polling interval. This is helpful as you can view any ticket updates directly without navigating to the Secureworks CTP dashboard. Any changes to the values are displayed in the Previous Value and Current Value fields.
