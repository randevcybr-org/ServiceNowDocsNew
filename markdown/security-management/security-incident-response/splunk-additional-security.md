# Automate notable event updates and closures

Security incidents can be created and updated after they are created with a bi-directional interface with the Splunk Enterprise Security integration.

## Before you begin

The Splunk Enterprise Security integration has a bi-directional interface that allows notable events to create security incidents as well as update the notable events after the security incident is created and/or closed.

Relevant incident details include SIR incident number, assignment group, SIR incident URL. This section is the final portion of the profile configuration set-up that provides optional capabilities to update the Splunk Enterprise Security notable events.

Role required: sn\_si.ingestion\_profile\_admin

**Note:** Users with the sn\_si.admin role can perform all operations available to a profile admin, as the sn\_si.admin role inherits the required permissions by default.

## Procedure

1.  If the Additional Options page on the progress bar is not displayed, select **Additional Options**.

2.  Follow the instructions below to complete the configuration for updating notable events based on security incident updates.

In addition to updating the notable status value, you can also post comments to the notable event incident review history.

</table>3.  Click **Finish** to complete the configuration.

    A confirmation dialog is displayed. You have successfully completed the setup and configuration for the integration. Activate this profile to pull notable events from the Splunk Enterprise Security console based on your scheduling. There is a limit of 1,000 security incidents that can be created in a 24-hour period. Up to 100 notable events are per fired alert. Subsequent notable events will be ignored after the limits are reached.
