5.  The selected profile is triggered manually.

6.  Review the work notes and activities section.

7.  View the tags and check the related lists for the data.

    **Note:** In addition to running the profile for the CI or the Alternate CI of the security incident, you could also run the profile for CI values present in the Configuration Item Related list by checking the Include Related CI on the dialog box. This will fetch data for the CI values present in the related list as well. Alternatively, you could run the profile just for the CI values present in the related list.
