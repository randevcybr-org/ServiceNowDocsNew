# Manage tasks using the Visual Task Board

Track and manage all the tasks associated with a major security incident using the Visual Task Board \(Kanban view\).

You can use the Visual Task Board to move the cards in a step-by-step manner between lanes like Draft, Assigned or Ready, In progress, and Closed depending on the status of the tasks. An activity stream on the board displays recent activity to track task changes easily. You can add task cards from any table that extends Task to quickly track updates and edit major security incidents directly from the board.
