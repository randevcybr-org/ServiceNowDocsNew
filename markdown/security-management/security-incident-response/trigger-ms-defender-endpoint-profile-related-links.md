# Trigger the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint capabilities from Related Links

Trigger a capability profile manually after reviewing a security incident from related links.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.admin or sn\_si.analyst

## About this task

In addition to running the profile for the CI or the Alternate CI of the security incident, you can also run the profile for CI values present in the Configuration Item related list by selecting **Include Related CI** in the dialog box. This retrieves the data for the CI values present in the related list as well. Alternatively, you could run the profile just for the CI values present in the related list.

2.  Select the security incident that you want to review with the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint information.

3.  In the Related Links section, click **Run EDR Profile\(s\)**.

4.  Browse and select a profile from the list of available profiles, and click **Submit**.
