# Restrict access to security incidents

Manage the access of the security incidents that contains sensitive information. You can enforce security incident restrictions to determine who can access a certain incident and limit the access only to specific users or groups.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.admin

## About this task

Security incident restrictions enable you to hide critical security incidents from being accessed by other users in a particular organization. These restrictions enable you to provide a more granular way to control the security incidents a user can access. You can enforce a security incident restriction by enabling the **Enforce restriction** check box, and then selecting the users or groups who are allowed to access the particular security incident.

After you enforce the restriction on specific security incidents and limit the access to certain users or groups, then all the other remaining users in your organization won’t be able to access these security incidents even if they search for a particular restricted security incident.

## Procedure

1.  Open a security incident that you want to restrict.

2.  If you are using classic UI, perform the following:

    1.  Click the **Restriction** tab.

    2.  Select the **Enforce restriction** check box to enable the restriction of the security incident.

        ![Restrict access to security incidents](../image/si-restriction.png)
