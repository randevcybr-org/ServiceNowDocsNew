# Splunk error reporting

Whenever a connectivity issue with your ServiceNow instance occurs, an error is logged in Splunk with information describing the problem.

Error messages are stored in a new index named **servicenow** with sourcetype **servicenow**.

To search for error logs, ensure you are specifying the **servicenow** index in your search. Alternatively, refer to the current Splunk documentation on how to add the new **servicenow** index to the default search indexes.
