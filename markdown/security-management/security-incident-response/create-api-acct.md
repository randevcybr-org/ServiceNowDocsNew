# Create an API account for the Check Point NGTP integration

An API account role is required in your ServiceNow AI Platform instance for this integration. The Username and Password associated with this account are created in the ServiceNow AI Platform and entered in Check Point, so the Check Point authenticates with the ServiceNow AI Platform when retrieving Block List entries.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The ServiceNow AI Platform admin creates an API account role \(sn\_sec\_checkpoint.api\_account\_access\). This account is used exclusively for entering credentials required for authentication on Check Point, so the Gateway can retrieve Block Lists from the ServiceNow AI Platform. This account is a separate, unique API user account in the ServiceNow AI Platform instance, and assigned to the Check Point administrator.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Organization** &gt; **Users**.

2.  Click the **Users** module.
