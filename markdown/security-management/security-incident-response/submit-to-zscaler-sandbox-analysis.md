# Submit to Zscaler Sandbox analysis

Use the Zscaler Internet Access products sandbox service to analyzes files in a virtual environment to detect malicious behavior.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.admin

## About this task

When you create a Zscaler configuration, a Zscaler sandbox submission is created by default in the Zscaler Sandbox Configuration module.

The name and source fields are auto-filled, and the configuration is enabled by default. You can edit only the display tag and the active options. Zscaler Internet Access product enables you to fetch only the sandbox report for the MD5 hash type observables.

The analysis for the file that is associated with the MD5 hash should be complete and the corresponding report should be in the Zscaler sandbox. If the MD5 hash that you send does not have a report in Zscaler, you get an error message.
