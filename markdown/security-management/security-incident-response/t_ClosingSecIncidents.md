# Close security incidents

When a security incident has transitioned to the Review state, it’s possible to close it and enter an appropriate closure code. Closure codes can be searched on later for ease of location.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.write

## About this task

## Procedure

1.  If the security incident you want to close isn’t already open, navigate to **Security Incident** &gt; **Incidents** &gt; **Show All Incidents**, and locate the security incident you want to close.

    **Note:** If there are any [post incident review assessments](t_PerformPostIncidentReview.md) that haven’t been completed for this security incident, the security incident can’t be closed. Return to **Security Incident** &gt; **Post Incident Review** &gt; **All Incomplete Reviews**, locate the reviews that are incomplete, and either ask the reviewers to complete their reviews or cancel the remaining assessments.

2.  Select the **Closure Information** tab and fill in the fields, as appropriate.
