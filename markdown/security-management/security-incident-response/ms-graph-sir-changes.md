# Security Incident Response form after alert ingestion

After a Microsoft Graph Security API alert has been ingested, a security incident is created and the corresponding updates are made to the security incident record.

## Worknotes

If you had selected the **Log work note for new alert** option in the alert Aggregation Criteria as described in the [Mapping alerts to security incident response fields](ms-graph-create-profile-map.md), a worknote is posted when the alert is aggregated.
