# Assessment trigger conditions examples

The following examples provide different scenarios on how mandatory and optional assessment trigger conditions are generated.

-   On the Assessment Trigger Condition form, generate mandatory assessments when the **Priority** and **Business Impact** for a security incident is set to **Critical** on the **Assessment Trigger Rule** page. In such scenario, the security analysts cannot close the incident until the mandatory assessments are completed.
-   If a security incident is in a **Review** state, security analysts cannot close the security incident without completing the **Post Incident Review Assessment**. An assessment link is available to take the assessment to the security analysts who are assigned \(or who had requested for the assessment\) to the incident.
-   On the Assessment Trigger Condition form, generate optional assessments when the **Priority** and **Business Impact** for a security incident is set to **High**. In this example, if the security analysts do not complete the assessments and close the security incident, the assessments are automatically canceled.
-   In case, if the mandatory or optional assessments does not match the security incident, assessments are not generated for such security incidents. A security analyst can close the security incident without completing the Post Incident Review assessment.
