# Activate an EDL manually

If the Palo Alto Networks firewall administrator is not using the ServiceNow AI Platform, and you are directly notified that the Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall is configured, you can activate the External Dynamic List \(EDL\) manually.

## Before you begin

In Palo Alto Networks, assign an EDL object, policy, and the source URL to the EDL you created. For more information about configuring the EDL to the Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall in Palo Alto Networks, see [Configure an EDL](paloalto-config_firewall_pa.md).

Role required: sn\_si.admin

## Result

The EDL is activated and ready to receive EDL entries

## What to do next

Submit EDL entries from a security incident or from the blocklist.

-   **[Configure an EDL](paloalto-config_firewall_pa.md)**  
The Palo Alto Networks firewall administrator configures an EDL to the Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall once notified the Retrieval URL is available from the ServiceNow AI Platform. Before the EDL can accept EDL entries, it must be configured in Palo Alto Networks, and activated in the ServiceNow AI Platform®.
