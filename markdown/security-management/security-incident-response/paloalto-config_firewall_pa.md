# Configure an EDL

The Palo Alto Networks firewall administrator configures an EDL to the Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall once notified the Retrieval URL is available from the ServiceNow AI Platform. Before the EDL can accept EDL entries, it must be configured in Palo Alto Networks, and activated in the ServiceNow AI Platform®.

## Before you begin

Role required: Palo Alto Networks firewall administrator

## About this task

The Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall administrator creates an EDL object, and assigns the source \(Retrieval\) URL and policy to the EDL. These tasks are performed in Palo Alto Networks before the EDL is activated in the ServiceNow AI Platform.
