# Schedule the AWS Security Hub finding retrieval

Set a schedule to retrieve the finding data and to ingest the AWS Security Hub findings that match the criteria in the profile.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_sni.admin

## About this task

You can plan how often you want to poll for future AWS Security Hub findings that match the AWS Security Hub finding profile configuration.

The polling interval is configured for each profile individually. The different polling intervals may impact the performance of the AWS Security Hub findings integration. When scheduling, plan to balance the system load against the urgency of an incident. A one-minute default value is set for all profiles. You can modify this setting based on the urgency of the incident and the anticipated load on your system.

Any alerts that gets added to the incident in a particular polling interval is processed and then appended to the AWS Security Hub alerts related lists and comments.

## Procedure

1.  On the scheduling form, fill in the fields.

    Configure the schedule to define how and when you pull findings from the AWS Security Hub tenant.

One-Time Retrieval

</td><td>

Select this checkbox to allow one-time retrieval of historical AWS Security Hub findings and then do the reconciliation of the data. When you select this checkbox, the application will pull all the open and closed AWS Security Hub findings for the period up to 90 days approximately.When processing the data both ongoing findings and historical data are pulled, but the processing of the ongoing findings takes precedence over historical pull. Otherwise, the historical pull may take some time based on the duration as well as the number of findings that are ingested.

**Note:** The retrieved historical AWS Security Hub findings undergo de-duplication checks to prevent any duplicates within the Security Incident Response application.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Since date

</td><td>

The date since when the historical findings are ingested from AWS Security Hub.**Note:** The findings data is approximately pulled from the past 90 days.
