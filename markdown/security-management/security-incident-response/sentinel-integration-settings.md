# Review the Microsoft Azure Sentinel integration settings

Review the Microsoft Azure Sentinel integration settings so that you can modify the system properties to suit your environment.

## Before you begin

**Important:**

Microsoft has extended the deprecation of the Azure Sentinel experience in the Azure portal from March 2026 to March 2027.

If you are currently using the Azure Sentinel integration with Security Incident Response \(SIR\), we strongly recommend migrating to the new Defender portal integration as soon as possible. The Defender integration includes a built-in migration utility that automatically converts your existing Sentinel profiles into Defender profiles, while ensuring continuity of incidents created through Sentinel after the transition. For more information, see [Microsoft Sentinel to Defender Migration Guide](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2795226).

Role required: sn\_si.ingestion\_profile\_admin

**Note:** Users with the sn\_si.admin role can perform all operations available to a profile admin, as the sn\_si.admin role inherits the required permissions by default.
