# Create and configure a profile for sightings search with the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration

Create and configure the sightings search profile automatically using the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.admin, sn\_si.admin

## About this task

You can use the Sightings Search workflow to perform the sighting searches. This workflow accepts a list of observables, finds any implementing capabilities, creates the queries that are based on the sighting search configurations, and executes the searches that are based on the configured workflow.

The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides a base system sighting search profile that enables you to configure the automatic sighting searches. With this profile, you can access the related observable sighting information of an organization and also see the sightings from other organizations.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Integrations** &gt; **Sighting Search Configuration**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the following fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Name for the sighting search profile.|
    |Is saved search|Option to save the search configuration. The saved search configuration queries are example queries. You can substitute them with the parameters for your environment and create additional-saved search configurations as required.|

    |Search|Native search string that forms a query.|
