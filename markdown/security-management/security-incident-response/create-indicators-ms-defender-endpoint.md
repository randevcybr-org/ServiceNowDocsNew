# Create indicators in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Create indicators from associated observables of the security incident using the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.admin, sn\_si.analyst

## About this task

The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration allows observable enrichment for all the observable types that are mapped in the Observable-Indicator mapping module.

Create indicators provide you the ability to set a list of indicators for detection, and for blocking prevention and responses. You can create the indicators from associated observable of the security incident.
