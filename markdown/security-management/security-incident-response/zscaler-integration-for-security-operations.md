## Key features of the integration

This integration includes the following key features:

-   Reputation lookup of observables against the global threat library that the Zscaler product maintains.

    **Note:** The Zscaler global threat library lists threats by trends, country of origin, target destination, volume, and various threat categories. This global threat library enables you to investigate your observables against the global threat landscape.

-   Maintenance of observables in a block list or allow list on the Zscaler product.
-   Ability to fetch and review sandbox reports from the Zscaler product for an MD5 hash. The Cloud Sandbox feature in the Zscaler product runs and analyzes files in a virtual environment to detect malicious behavior.
-   Security alerts from Patient 0 events that are generated in the Zscaler product when a user downloads an unknown malicious file.
-   Multiple URL category lists that act as block lists or allow lists as defined in the Zscaler product.
-   ServiceNow AI Platform security incidents that can be tagged to identify the URL category that the observables are added to.
-   Expiration periods that maintain the size of the URL category list entries by automatically expiring or removing the older entries.
-   Approval workflow for adding and removing observables from the URL category lists.
-   URL category entries that can be linked to observable records and security incidents that include threat intelligence results and details about why an entry is blocked.
