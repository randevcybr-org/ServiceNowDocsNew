## Scheduled jobs for Microsoft Teams

Scheduled jobs are automated jobs that are run to process the notifications from Microsoft Teams chat connector and renew the Microsoft Teams subscriptions on a recurring schedule.

Role required: admin.

-   **MS Teams Chat Connector: Process Notification**

    For each chat message event, a notification is received which has the Resource ID and the notification stored in a table. A schedule job is run for every 30 seconds to pick unprocessed notifications and query the Microsoft Teams API to get the actual message contents, which are further stored in a different table.

-   **MS Teams Chat Connector: Renew Subscriptions**

    For each channel within the team, subscriptions are created to get notified of the created, updated, and deleted events. This subscription is active only for 60 minutes. The subscriptions are renewed every 25 minutes through the Microsoft Teams Connector: Renew Notification schedule job.
