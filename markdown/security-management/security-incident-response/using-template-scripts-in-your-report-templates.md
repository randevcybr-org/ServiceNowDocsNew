# Use Template Scripts in your Report Templates

Create a script to include the related lists data, date operations, and any other data that aren’t directly dot-walkable.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_msi.workspace\_manager

## About this task

You can use this predefined template script in your report templates to include any related data after the report templates are configured and customized.

Construct a template script to display the related list data on the report template. If you want to utilize and populate any template script, then you must add the tag template script tag as: `${template_script:script name}`.

Example: `${template_script:msi_collab_cards}`

**Note:** You can’t delete the predefined template scripts. An error message is displayed if a user with an admin role attempts to delete a template script record if it’s mapped with any report template.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Major Security Incident Management** &gt; **MSI Administration** &gt; **Status Report Setup**.

    The MSI Status Report Setup page displays.

2.  Drill down to **Report Template** &gt; **Template Scripts**.
