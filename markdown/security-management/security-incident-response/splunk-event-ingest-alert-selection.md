# Select scheduled alerts for the Splunk Enterprise Event Ingestion integration

After you have created a profile for a scheduled alert, select a Splunk alert for this profile that you want to map to a ServiceNow AI Platform Security Incident Response security incident.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.ingestion\_profile\_admin

**Note:** Users with the sn\_si.admin role can perform all operations available to a profile admin, as the sn\_si.admin role inherits the required permissions by default.

## About this task

View the available alerts in your ServiceNow AI Platform instance so you know which field values are available for mapping. Select an alert to verify that you receive the expected results on the basic form layout before you map the values to fields on SIR security incidents. You can only select one alert from the list in this form.

## Procedure

1.  If the Alert Selection page is not displayed, select it on the progress bar to display it.

    By default, the core Search &amp; Reporting App is selected.

2.  If the alert to be ingested is part of a different Splunk app, select **Splunk App Selection** and choose your Splunk app from the **Selected App** list.

3.  From the **Alert List**, choose an alert and move it to from the **Available** column to the **Selected** column.

    You can also choose multiple alerts. If the alerts are selected as part of a single profile, then the alerts will have common field mappings and profile settings.

    The list of alerts on this form matches the list of alerts in your Splunk console. Up to 500 alerts are displayed on this form. If there are more than 500 alerts listed in your Splunk console on the Alerts page, only the first 500 alerts are displayed on this form in your ServiceNow AI Platform instance.
