# Get Log Data Flow

If Security Incident Response, Threat Intelligence, and Palo Alto Networks - Firewall are activated, the **Security Operations Palo Alto Networks - Get Log Data** flow automatically executes when the Source IP for observables in a security incident is changed.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.analyst

## About this task

During flow execution, firewall configuration information is retrieved from the database and the API Key is retrieved from the firewall. The Get Log action queues up a search query on the firewall. When the query runs, it returns a Job ID that is used to retrieve threat logs data from the firewall. It attaches the log data as an XML file to the security incident.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to a security incident that contains observables.

2.  Click the **Security Incident Observables** tab.

3.  In **Source IP**, add or modify the IP address.

4.  Click **Update**.

    The **Security Operations Palo Alto Networks - Get Log Data** flow executes and enriched threat log data is attached to the security incident. The information is also parsed and displayed in the **Firewall Logs** section under the **Enrichment Data** tab.


## Palo Alto Firewall- Get Log Action

The **Palo Alto Firewall: Get Log** flow action schedules a query on the firewall to retrieve logs and returns a JobID used to retrieve the log data.

### Input variables

Input variables determine the initial behavior of the action.

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|FirewallIpAddress \[string\]|The IP address of the firewall. This input variable is mandatory.|
|FirewallApiKey \[string\]|The API access key of the firewall. This input variable is mandatory.|
|FirewallLogType \[string\]|The type of log data to be retrieved \(set to threat\). This input variable is mandatory.|
|FirewallLogFilterQuery \[string\]|The query to be executed to search for logs on the firewall. This input variable is mandatory.|
|LogDirection \[string\]|Specifies whether logs are shown oldest first \(backward\) or newest first \(forward\) order.|
|LogNumber \[string\]|Specifies the number of logs to retrieve.|
|LogSkipCount \[string\]|Specifies the number of logs to skip when doing a log retrieval.|

### Output variables

The output variables contain data that can be used in subsequent actions. The output consists of data from the firewall configuration, as well as dynamically generated data.

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|QueuedJobID \[string\]|The Job ID returned from the firewall.|
|JobScheduled \[string\]|Specifies \(success or failure\) whether the job was sent to the firewall.|
|error \[string\]|Any errors returned.|

## Palo Alto Firewall- Job Data Action

After the **Palo Alto Firewall: Get Log** action queues the search query to the firewall and the job runs, the **Palo Alto Firewall: Job Data Action** action retrieves the threat log data from the firewall.

### Input variables

Input variables determine the initial behavior of the action. All input fields are mandatory.

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|FirewallIpAddress \[string\]|The IP address of the firewall.|
|FirewallApiKey \[string\]|The API access key of the firewall.|
|JobID \[string\]|The ID of the queued job.|

### Output variables

The output variables contain data that can be used in subsequent actions. The output consists of data from the firewall configuration, as well as dynamically generated data.

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|commandStatus \[string\]|Specifies \(success or failure\) whether data was retrieved from the firewall.|
|JobData \[string\]|The data collected from the firewall.|
|error \[string\]|Any errors returned.|
