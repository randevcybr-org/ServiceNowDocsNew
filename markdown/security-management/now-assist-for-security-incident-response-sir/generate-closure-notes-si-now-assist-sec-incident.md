# Generate closure notes for a security incident with Now Assist for Security Incident Response

Automatically generate a draft of the closure notes for a security incident when you close it. The draft is editable and will be reviewed prior to closing the security incident, and it can be used or modified as needed. Closure notes provide information about the resolution of a security incident to other analysts, managers, and key stakeholders.

## Before you begin

Roles required: sn\_si.analyst, sn\_si.manager, or sn\_si.basic

**Note:**

If the Close code or Close notes fields are already updated for a security incident, Now Assist will not modify these fields, regardless of the incident’s current state. To enable Now Assist to update these fields, ensure that both the Close Code and Closure Notes fields are left blank.

## Procedure

1.  In the legacy Core UI, navigate to **All** &gt; **Security Incident** &gt; **Incidents** and open a security incident that is assigned to you.

2.  Alternatively, navigate to **All** &gt; **Security Incident** &gt; **Security Incident Response Workspace** and open a security incident that is assigned to you.

3.  Close the security incident.

The Closure modal is displayed.

2.  Click on the **Close notes** section. The close notes will be auto-generated if no text exists, or you can modify the existing text as needed by choosing the required option from NACM.

**Note:** You might want to review the generated text and make sure it's accurate before you close the security incident. Edit the notes or delete them to provide your own. You can also **Elaborate** or **Shorten** the generated text.

3.  Select the required option from the Now Assist Context menu. **Elaborate** will help you to elaborate the text and replaces the selected resolution text. In case, if you wish to shorten the resolution text you can select **Shorten** option from the Context menu to make the text more concise.
4.  Update the Close code and select **Close incident**.

The resolution summary is displayed in the Resolution Information section on the security incident record.

**Note:** Using the Now Assist Context menu, you can directly add or generate the resolution notes in the **Close notes** section on the incident record itself, when the incident is in the **Review** state. For more information, see the screen shot below.
