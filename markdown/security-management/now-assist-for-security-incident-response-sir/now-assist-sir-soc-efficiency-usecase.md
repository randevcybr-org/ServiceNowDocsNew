# Security Incident Response AI agent collection for the Analyze security operations metrics agentic workflow

The Analyze security operations metrics agentic workflow helps security operations center managers analyze the performance of their security teams.

## The Analyze security operations metrics agentic workflow overview

Security operations center \(SOC\) managers can analyze metrics for overall case volume, mean time to assign \(MTTA\), and mean time to resolve \(MTTR\) on security incident response \(SIR\) records to give them insight into their security analysts' performance. They can also ask for recommendations for how to improve the metrics.

## Agents used in the Analyze security operations metrics agentic workflow

-   Security incident retrieval AI agent
-   Security metrics analysis AI agent
