You can configure multiple instances for the Microsoft Defender Mitigation Control Integration.

## Before you begin

Roles required:

    |SMS Scripts|Read|Yes|
    |SMS Scripts|Delete|Yes|
    |SMS Scripts|Modify|Yes|

-   Microsoft SCCM credentials that include the Script Approvers role. The script created to import mitigation information requires approval in your Microsoft SCCM console by user with the Script Approvers role.
