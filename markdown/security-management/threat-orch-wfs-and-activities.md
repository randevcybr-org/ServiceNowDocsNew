# Threat Intelligence Orchestration workflows and activities

The base system includes workflows and workflow activities you can use to automate actions on your instance.

**Parent Topic:**[Threat Intelligence Orchestration](c_ThreatIntelligenceOrchestration.md)

## Threat Intelligence - Run IoC Lookup workflow

The **Threat Intelligence - Run IoC Lookup** workflow checks whether there is an unexpired observable and if so, the lookup is set to **Complete** and updated with the data from the observable.

### Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.basic

**Note:** This workflow replaces Threat Intelligence Orchestration business rules \(**Populate with existing IoC tables**, **Queue the lookup**, and **Update observable**\) with activities.

If a lookup is inserted or updated and meets the conditions, the Lookup business rule triggers this workflow.

### About this task

The **Threat Intelligence - Run IoC Lookup**workflow checks whether there is an unexpired observable and if so, the lookup is set to **Complete** and updated with the data from the observable. Any indicators associated with the observable are reactivated.

If the observable is expired, the workflow runs the lookups and increments the **Sighting count** in the existing, expired observable.

If no correlating observable exists, a new observable with indicator is created.

Workflow process activities include:

-   [Populate lookup with observable activity](threat-orch-wfs-and-activities.md#)
-   [Perform IoC Lookup activity](threat-orch-wfs-and-activities.md#)
-   Wait for lookup \(core activity\)
-   [Update observable with lookup result activity](threat-orch-wfs-and-activities.md#)

### Populate lookup with observable activity

If an unexpired observable is found, the **Threat Intelligence Orchestration - Populate lookup with observable** workflow activity supplies data from an existing observable to a lookup. This activity can accelerate the investigation and remediation process.

When triggered by a workflow **Populate lookup with observable** attempts to find an existing observable for a lookup that matches the **value** and **type** of the lookup provided to the activity as input.

If the observable exists and is not expired, this activity:

-   Updates the lookup with the information found in the observable
-   Reactivates an indicator if it is inactive, increments the **Encountered count**, and updates the **Last seen** date
-   Sets **State** to Complete.

#### Input variables

Input variables determine the initial behavior of the activity.

|Input variable|Description|
|--------------|-----------|
|scanID\[string\]|lookup identifier|

#### Output variables

The output variables contain data that can be used in subsequent activities.

|Output variables|Description|
|----------------|-----------|
|True|Found valid observable and updated lookup.|
|False|Did not find valid observable. Observable is either missing or expired.|

### Perform IoC Lookup activity

The **Threat Intelligence Orchestration - Perform IoC Lookup** workflow activity performs a given lookup. This activity can accelerate the investigation and remediation process.

When triggered by a workflow, **Perform IoC Lookup** takes a scanID, looks up the lookup record, and adds the lookup to the queue by creating a lookup queue entry.

#### Input variables

Input variables determine the initial behavior of the activity.

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|scanID\[string\]|lookup identifier|

#### Output variables

The output variables contain data that can be used in subsequent activities.

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|True|Triggered the lookup.|
|False|Did not trigger the lookup.|

### Update observable with lookup result activity

The **Threat Intelligence Orchestration - Update observable with lookup result** workflow activity updates the observable record. If one does not exist, it creates a new observable. This activity is useful for logging information.

When triggered by a workflow **Update observable with lookup result** updates an existing observable to include the new **Sighting count**, adds a note, and, if inactive, reactivates any indicators. The **Encountered count** and **Last seen** date in the indicator are also updated.

If no correlating observable exists, the workflow creates a new observable with indicator as follows:

-   Runs the IoC lookups
-   Creates a new observable
-   Creates an indicator for the observable
-   Adds a **Sighting count** to the observable
-   Adds an **Encountered count** and **Last seen** date to the indicator
-   Adds a message indicating from which lookup it was created

.

#### Input variables

Input variables determine the initial behavior of the activity.

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|scanID\[string\]|Lookup identifier.|

#### Output variables

The output variables contain data that can be used in subsequent activities.

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|True|Update or creation of observable is successful.|
|False|Update or creation of observable failed.|

### Run Default IoC Lookup Sources activity

When triggered by a workflow, Threat Intelligence - **Run Default IoC Lookup Sources** takes in a lookup request ID and creates multiple lookups depending on the entered data values.

For each data type, the **include\_in\_bulk scan** column of the supported lookup type table of each lookup source is evaluated. If true, a lookup is added to the lookup request.

#### Input variables

Input variables determine the initial behavior of the activity.

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|scan\_request\_id|Lookup request system identifier|

#### Output variables

The output variables contain data that can be used in subsequent activities.

|Variable|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Number of scans created|Integer|
