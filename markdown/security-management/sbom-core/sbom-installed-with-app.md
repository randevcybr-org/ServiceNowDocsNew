# Components installed with Software Bill of Materials applications

Several types of components are installed with activation of the Software Bill of Materials applications, including tables, user roles, and scheduled jobs.

## Roles installed

<table id="table_djn_vnw_zyb"><thead><tr><th>

Role title \[name\]

Contains roles

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

sn\_sbom\_response.managelicense

</td><td>

This role is installed with the SBOM Response application.

 This role permits you to resolve licenses to components.

</td><td>

None

</td></tr><tr><td>

sn\_sbom\_response.licenseresolver

</td><td>

This role is installed with the SBOM Response application.

 This role permits you to view uploaded license information and determines which licenses are permitted and which are banned.

</td><td>

None

</td></tr><tr><td>

SBOM write \[sn\_sbom\_dm.app\_write\], SBOM create \[sn\_sbom\_dm.app\_create\], SBOM read \[sbom\_dm.app\_read\]

</td><td>

These roles are installed with the Data Model for SBOM application.

 They permit you to read, create, and edit records in SBOM tables.

</td><td>

None

</td></tr><tr><td>

SBOM Cores ingests \[sn\_sbom\_core.sbom\_ingest\] and SBOM Core admin \[ sn\_sbom\_core.admin\]

</td><td>

These roles are installed with the SBOM Core application.

 The sn\_sbom\_core.sbom\_ingest role permits you to upload SBOMs manually and via the REST API. The sn\_sbom\_core.admin role permits you to create, read, edit data, and upload SBOMs.

 This role also gives you access to the SBOM Core modules in your instance. It inherits the roles from the Data Model for SBOM application.
