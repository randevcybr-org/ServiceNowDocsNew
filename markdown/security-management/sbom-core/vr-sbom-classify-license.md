# Classify imported licenses in the Software Bill of Materials Workspace

Classify the component licenses you upload with your SBOM files with the License Classification feature.

## Before you begin

Classifying new license information is an ongoing process. You might prefer to keep the total number displayed on the Unclassified card low. As a license manager, you might prefer to check for licenses that need classification every few days and after you upload SBOM files.

Role required: sn\_sbom\_response.managelicense

## Procedure
