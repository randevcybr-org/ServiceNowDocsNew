# Add an exception approver for Configuration Compliance

Add users to the approver groups so that you can request an exception for a remediation task in Configuration Compliance.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vulc.admin

## About this task

An exception request for a remediation task is approved using the default two-level approval workflow. Adding users to the first-level group is mandatory. If there are no users in the second level, the request is automatically approved after the first-level approval.

**Note:** If there's no first-level approver, an exception can't be requested.

**Note:** Upto Configuration Compliance v13.0, if there's no first-level approver, an exception can't be requested. However, starting from Configuration Compliance v13.0, if you are deploying the CC application for the first time, the flow designer for exception management is enabled by default. If you are already using the workflow, you can update to the flow designer. In both cases, you cannot change it back to workflow.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Security** &gt; **Users and Groups** &gt; **Groups**.

2.  In the Name column, search for **Exception**, and click **Exception Approver - Level 1 CC**.

    **Note:** Starting from Configuration Compliance v14.7.5, you can use the system properties provided in the base system for exception approvals via workflow in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table. So, when an exception request is raised via workflow, it’s sent for approval to the group IDs defined in the system property. Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Properties** and select **sn\_vulc.exception\_approver\_L1\_CC** or **sn\_vulc.exception\_approver\_L2\_CC** to change the property value.

3.  On the Group Exception Approver - Level 1 CC form, navigate to **Group Members** &gt; **New** \(or **Edit**\).

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.
