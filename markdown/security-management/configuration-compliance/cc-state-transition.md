# Test result and remediation task state transitions in the Configuration Compliance application

The states of configuration test records and their associated remediation tasks \(RTs\) are impacted if test result records are deferred, resolved, reopened, and transferred to other remediation efforts \(REs\).

## State transition scenarios between test results and remediation tasks

**Note:** Starting with v14.9 of Configuration Compliance, the following terms have been renamed:
