## ServiceNow Prisma Cloud Integrations

The Vulnerability Response Integration with Palo Alto Prisma Cloud application helps import the Prisma data to your ServiceNow instance to enrich your instance for better management. A series of scheduled jobs invoke the integrations automatically. You can also run these scheduled jobs manually. Scheduled jobs simplify the test results remediation life cycle by keeping the instance updated by retrieving data periodically from Prisma Cloud.

Prisma Cloud integration tasks involve the following roles.

-   sn\_vul\_prismacloud.configure\_integration: Ability to read, write, and delete records.
-   sn\_vul\_prismacloud.read\_integration: Ability to read records.
