</table>6.  To save the changes, select **Update**.

    **Note:** Prior to v13.0, the workflow process is functional if there are users only in Exception level 1. However, starting from v13.0, there must be at least one user in each level.

    Prior to v13.0, in the workflow, if there was no user in the second level, the remediation task was deferred. However, v13.0 onwards, if there is no user in the second level, the approval request is automatically rejected.


## Example

There can be different approval levels for remediation tasks for Linux and Windows servers.
