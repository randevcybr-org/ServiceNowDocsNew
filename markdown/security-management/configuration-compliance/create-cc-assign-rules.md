# Create or edit Configuration Compliance assignment rules

Create rules to automatically assign test results based on filter conditions. These rules assign test results as they are imported.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_vulc.admin

## About this task

The base system ships with one Configuration Compliance assignment rule, **Assign to CI support group**, which assigns test results to the same assignment group as the CI support group. This rule is inactive by default. You can modify using filter conditions. With assignment rules, you define one or more conditions of assignment and the order of execution. Once a test result matches a rule condition, the assignment lookup stops.

**Note:** New or updated rules are automatically evaluated on the next import or manually using the **Apply Changes** button on the Assignment Rules list.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration Compliance** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Assignment Rules**.

2.  Open the **Assign to CI support group** rule or click **New**.

3.  Edit the **Assign to CI support group** rule, or if **New**, fill in the fields on the form, as appropriate.

Name

</td><td>

Name of the assignment rule.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Execution order

</td><td>

Order in which the rules are evaluated. The lowest number is evaluated first.

 High priority rules, test results that need special handling, where risk is critical, or a test result that should be handled by regulatory compliance, should be run first. Next, run your general rules, where no special handling is required, and you know who should be responsible for them. Finally, create a default rule to assign test results to the group that figures out what assignment group it should belong to. This group could add another rule to cover their decisions. This default rule would run last.
