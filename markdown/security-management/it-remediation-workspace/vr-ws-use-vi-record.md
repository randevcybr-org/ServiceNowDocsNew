-   sn\_vul.remediation\_owner for host vulnerable items \(VITs\)
-   sn\_vul.app\_security\_champion for application vulnerable items \(AVITs\)
-   sn\_vul\_container.remediation\_owner for container vulnerable items \(CVITs\)
-   sn\_vulc.remediation\_owner for configuration test results \(CTRs\)

## Procedure

1.  In your ServiceNow AI Platform instance, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **IT Remediation Workspace**.

    The Home landing page is displayed.

2.  Navigate to a vulnerable item record and open it from either the Home landing page or the List view.
