# Create a list in the IT Remediation Workspace

With the List view in the IT Remediation Workspace, you can view remediation tasks and records assigned to you and your groups. You can also track your exception and false positive requests for remediation tasks \(VUL, AVUL, CVUL, and CRG\), vulnerable items \(VIT, AVIT, and CVIT\), and test results \(TRs\) and view solutions.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   sn\_vul.remediation\_owner for host vulnerable items \(VITs\)
-   sn\_vul.app\_security\_champion for application vulnerable items \(AVITs\)
-   sn\_vul\_container.remediation\_owner for container vulnerable items \(CVITs\)
-   sn\_vulc.remediation\_owner for configuration test results \(CTRs\)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Vulnerability Response** &gt; **IT Remediation Workspace**.

2.  Select the List icon \(![List icon](../../secops-analyst-workspace/image/listview-icon.png)\).

    The List view displays.

    -   Click a filtered list to view the total number of active remediation tasks or records assigned to you or your group. See [Use remediation task records in the IT Remediation Workspace](vr-ws-remed-task.md) for more information about what you can do from these records.
    -   View the total number of VIs assigned to you or your groups that have solutions. Click the **Preferred solutions on VIs** card to display the list.
    -   See the vulnerable CIs assigned to you and your groups that have vulnerabilities on them on the **Vulnerable CIs** tab or on the Vulnerable CIs assigned to you and your group list on the List view.
3.  Select the **My Lists** tab.

4.  Select **Add new list**.

5.  Create the list either based on an existing list or your own setup.

<table id="choicetable_exp_nhg_jdc"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d39814e163">

**List based on an existing list**

</td><td>

1.  Select the **Start from existing** tab.
2.  In the **List** field, select the existing list to use as a template fro the drop-down list.
3.  Provide the name for the list in the**List Name** field.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d39814e202">

**Newly created list**

</td><td>

1.  Select **Create your own**
2.  Provide the name for the list in the**List Name** field.
3.  Select the source whose data you want to filter in the list.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>6.  Create a filtered list.

    1.  In the **Select columns** field, determine which columns will appear in the list by deleting any fields that you don't want to appear.

    2.  Provide conditions to filter the list.

        To add more than one condition, select **New condition set**.

        For example, if you wanted to create a list of active vulnerable items for a scanner you want to monitor, you might enter the conditions **\[Active\]\[is\]\[true\]** and **\[Source\]\[contains\]\[scanner-name\]**.

    3.  Select **Create**.

        Your new list is displayed.

        **Note:** If you leave the list module, the list displayed when you exit is the list you see when you return. To delete the custom lists you create, with the list displayed, on the right of the pane, select the gear icon and then select **Delete**.

7.  Refer to the following table for what you can do from the list view.
