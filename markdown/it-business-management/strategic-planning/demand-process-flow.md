# Demand workflow

The demand workflow defines the life-cycle of a request, from initial intake through assessment and approval to downstream execution. This structured approach ensures that each request is evaluated consistently, aligned with business objectives, and supported by the right processes before any resources are committed.

## Workflow overview

The end-to-end life-cycle for managing demands is described in the following table. This workflow confirms that the demands are progressively refined, validated, and aligned with business and strategic objectives.

**Note:** The demand workflow overview table describes the traditional demand management process. You can customize the states and activities according to the requirements of your organization by defining your custom playbook.
