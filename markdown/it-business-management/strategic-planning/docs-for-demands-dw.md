# Docs for demands in Next Experience for Demand Management

Store and manage documentation for demands from a centralized location in Next Experience for Demand Management.

## Docs overview

Demand managers can store information for demands using the Docs feature.

-   Each demand can have a separate doc page to capture related information. For example, create a doc page for business objectives or technical requirements.
-   Each demand can have multiple doc pages to help you effectively organize key artifacts.
-   Predefined templates such as Project Brief, Product Requirements, Brainstorming Ideas, and Meeting Notes are available. Create doc pages using one of these templates or start with an empty page.

## Features of Docs

The following are the key features of Docs:

-   Auto-save content.
-   See who is viewing or working on a doc page using the feature of live user presence.
-   Create documents using pre-defined templates.
-   Use rich text paragraph formatting, which includes headings, lists, alignment, and others.
-   Move text blocks to change their placement using block-level editing.
-   Tag team members inline or insert tables using the **/** command.
-   Add reference to other ServiceNow AI Platform tables to connect work across teams.
-   Insert images by uploading files or using web URLs.

    **Note:** The experience of inserting Google Images links might not work.


## Real-time collaboration in Docs

With the feature of real-time collaboration, edit a doc page concurrently with multiple other editors. Colored cursors denote the current location of each editor on the page. You can choose to show or hide these live presence indicators based on your preference while working on or reviewing the content of the page.

**Note:** A huge number of users editing the same block of content simultaneously might result in issues with application performance.

## Dynamic data linking in Docs

Keep record information in your documentation always current and reduce manual effort with the Dynamic data linking feature in Docs. You can now reference any ServiceNow application record and Docs will automatically reflect the latest updates from those records.

For example, if you add a reference to a Project record, the reference shows the latest field information of the project in Docs without requiring manual edits. Selecting the project reference opens up the project form so that you can view the full details of the project and make any necessary changes.

A hover popover displays the details of the mentioned record, providing quick access to additional information without leaving the current context.

Dynamic linking also enables adding references to a particular field of a record, such as Assigned to of a Project record.

You can add references from any ServiceNow table you have access to, with no setup or configuration needed.

This feature reduces the need to switch between multiple ServiceNow applications within your instance and helps maintain a single, reliable source of truth for collaborative work, making it easier for teams to stay aligned and informed.

## Images in Docs

Insert images into your Docs by uploading a file from your device or adding a web URL. Note that inserting Google Images links might not work.

Save images from your CWM documents directly to your device, making it easier to share or use them outside of the Docs environment. Click an image to access the download icon \(![](../../collab-work-mgmt/images/cwm-icon-docs-image-download.png)\), then click the icon to save it to your device. Alternatively, right-click the image and use your browser's built-in save option.
