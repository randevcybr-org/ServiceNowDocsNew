Use this dashboard when you wish to dive into open requests divided by Age.

![Open request age monitor showing the 0-1 day bucket](../image/open-req-age-monitor.png)

## Indicators

-   **Number of open requests**

    Records on the Request \[sc\_req\_item\] table opened on or before today and not closed.

-   **Average age of updated since of open requests**

    Result of the formula `[[Summed age of updated since of open request]] / [[Number of open requests]] / 24`

-   **Average age of open request**

    The result in days of the formula `[[Summed age of open request]] / [[Number of open requests]] / 24`

-   **Average re-assignment of open requests**

    Result of the formula `[[Summed re-assignment of open request]] / [[Number of open requests]] / 24`


Indicators not appearing in dashboard widgets but used in formulas:

-   **Summed age of open request**

    The aggregate sum of the Requests.Age.Hours script. This script calculates the difference between the latest and the first time stamp for an open item request record.

-   **Summed re-assignment of open request**

    The aggregate sum of reassignment counts for open requests

-   **Summed age of updated since of open request**

    The aggregate sum of the results of the script Requests.UpdatedSince.Hours. This script calculates the difference between the last update of an open request \(sys\_updated\_on\) and the last second of yesterday \(score\_end\) and returns negative value if sys\_updated\_on is after score\_end.
