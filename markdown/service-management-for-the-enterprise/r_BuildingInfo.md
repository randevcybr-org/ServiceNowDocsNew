-   This information is used to create a building in alm\_building.
-   The `id` is mapped to the external building id in alm\_building.
-   The `display_name` is used to name the building.
-   The `ref frame` is used to align the building horizontally and vertically. The GeoJSON data, contains WGS 84 information used to rotate the image so it displays at a natural horizontal orientation.
