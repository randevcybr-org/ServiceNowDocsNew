# Request approvals

Approving a request in an SM application means that the request is ready for task creation and assignment.

When a request is sent to a user with the \[SM application\]\_approver\_user role, the approver has several choices. If you select **Approval is required for new requests** in the applications Configuration screen, a newly created request automatically moves to the **Awaiting Approval** state. Otherwise, the request moves to the next configured state.
