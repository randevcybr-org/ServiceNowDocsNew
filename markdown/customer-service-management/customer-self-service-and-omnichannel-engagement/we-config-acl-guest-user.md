# Configure ACL for guest access

Enable guest users to access catalog items or knowledge articles by activating the required guest access control lists \(ACLs\).

## Before you begin

You must activate the Web Components for Guest \(sn\_guest\_component\) plugin. For more information, see [Activate Web Embeddables](act-web-embeddables.md).

Role required: security\_admin

## About this task

Guest ACLs control what content and actions are available to guest users on your website. These ACLs determine which knowledge articles guests can view and which catalog items they can submit. By default, all guest ACLs are inactive to maintain security.

Activate only the ACLs that correspond to the components you want to make available to guests. For example, if you embed catalog item components on your website, activate the catalog item ACLs. If you embed knowledge article components, activate the knowledge ACLs. This selective activation ensures guests can access only the content and functionality you explicitly allow.

## Procedure

1.  In the filter navigator, enter `Access Control (ACL)`.

2.  On the Access Controls page, in the Application column, enter `Web Components for Guest Embeddables`.

3.  In the Description field, enter any of the following:

    -   Enter `*[Guest Embeddables | Knowledge]` to view ACLs related to KB article.
    -   Enter `*[Guest Embeddables | Catalog Item]` to view ACLs related to catalog item.
4.  In the Name column, search and select the ACLs you need to activate.

5.  In the ACLs page, select the **Active** checkbox.

6.  Select **Update**.


## Result

Guest users can now access the catalog items or knowledge articles based on the ACLs you activated. The system applies these ACLs when guests interact with embedded components on your website.
