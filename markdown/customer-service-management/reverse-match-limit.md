# Limit the number of task sys\_ids returned for reverse matching rules

Reverse matching rules return a list of case sys\_ids. Limit the number of cases returned by configuring the number in the reverse.matchingrule.entity.limit system property.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  In the navigation filter, type `sys_properties.list`.

2.  Search for the reverse.matchingrule.entity.limit system property.

3.  In the number field, change the number of cases returned.

    The default number is 30.


## Result

If the number of cases returned is more than the value listed in the system property, the reverse matching rule doesn’t run for Scripted and Selection Criteria matching rules.
