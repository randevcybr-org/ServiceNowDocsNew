# Assign responsibilities

Use the responsibility data model to assign responsibilities to a service organization \(SO\) member.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Businesses often need staff to work at more than one business location, and they can have different responsibilities at different locations. Using the responsibility data model, an SO member can be assigned multiple responsibilities.

The responsibility data model tracks the relationship between the SO members and their responsibility type in the Service Organization Member Responsibilities \[sn\_csm\_svc\_org\_member\_responsibility\] table.

**Note:** If the business location plugin is active, this feature is enabled by default. However, for upgrade customers, the data in the \[sn\_csm\_svc\_org\_member\_responsibility\] table will be auto-populated for existing SO members to confirm that they retain as much access after the upgrade. Any new records created after the Australia release must be created using the following steps.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Service Organizations** &gt; **Internal/External Business Locations**.

2.  Open the business location \(internal or external\) record.

3.  Open the SO Member record from the Members related list.

4.  Select **New** to create a record in the SO Member Responsibilities \[sn\_csm\_svc\_org\_member\_responsibility\] table.

    The Organization Member Responsibility record shows the following fields: **Member**, **Type**, and **Order**.

    **Note:** The **Member** field refers to the \[sn\_csm\_service\_organization\_member\] table. This field is auto-populated if the record is initiated from the SO Member related list. The **Type** field refers to the \[sn\_customerservice\_related\_party\_configuration\] table, and the **Order** field specifies the sequence in which records are displayed, organized according to business preferences.

    With the base system, users with a specific role can be assigned a particular type.
